    "In this report, we will look into NVIDIA stock prices. We have two datasets, data about the stock movement, and a dataset containing news articles. The goal of the assignment is to use the news articles in order to predict the stock movement. We will use NLP methods to process the news article into more interpretable variables which can be used to predict the stock movement. \n",

So the the writing style will be understandable for the audience of news readers, which may differ a lot depending on the news outline. But it will probably be not super technical and jargon heavy. For the language, I also do not know what language the data is from, but from initial viewing, it is prodomnatly engish. The language will be dependent on the provider of the news article, and the language of articles from a distinct provider will probably stay constant."
