Once the Kickstarter is over I will work on a survey where you can list what the additional amounts are for, and what pins/colors/stickers you want from your pledges!',\n \"Ã‚\\xa0 Sticker options limited to: Koi (Dark Purple or White on Holofoil), and Nukekubi, Red and Black Kitsune, Bake Maneki Neko, Teal Kirin, and Turquoise Ryuu on Metallic.  The choices were based on a poll of most popular selections and personal choice.   Want to add a foxfire pin or sticker(s) to your current pledge?  If you have pledged, on the main campaign page, there should be a button in the top right in green saying 'Manage your pledge'. Once clicked, choose 'change my pledge'. You can then edit your pledge amount. If you would like a sticker, they are an additional $3 each. If you would like the foxfire pin, they are $5 each. On the survey I will have a space you can fill out for what the additional amount is for that has been pledged.  For first time backers that only want stickers or the foxfire pin, I have made these rewards available. However, if you are wanting stickers and then change your mind to add a pin, please do not add it to this pledge and select a pin tier instead as shipping is treated differently.   Thank you!!\",\n \"Wow. What a blast that we have met funding with time to spare!  Thank you all!  I'm currently working on considering my options for stickers and pairing down options, as well as a bonus item that can be added on for a small amount. Once I have samples in hand (and perhaps a little more cushion to support their purchase) I will announce options!\",\n \"I wished for a fish and got two!  All Kitsune are unlocked! Once we get to the Torii Gate, that means all dragons are unlocked too.   As previously mentioned, I'm looking into sticker options and fancy paper types. Making -all- stickers and variants may be too much for me right now, so I'm looking to see what options are most popular. I'm looking at stickers that come in around the 2in mark depending on their dimensions, ie. 2x2 or 3x2 if they are more square or rectangle. They would be an add-on option for perhaps $3 each.Ã‚\\xa0 I have a poll below, multiple options available. Please only select those you would seriously consider adding on to your pledge.  I think it would look really cool to do Bake Maneki Neko, Nukekubi, and the fish in special paper (ie. shiny or metalic looking), but am torn on variant designs and what others may consider their personal or the popular choices.Ã‚\\xa0  Ã‚\\xa0Ã‚\\xa0Ã‚\\xa0Ã‚\\xa0 https://www.strawpoll.me/15767171  Thank you!\",\n \"Thank you everyone!  I'd have drawn a thank you for the Nukekubi but drawing their design again would take me days. Haha.  The Teal (Haku-Esque) color version won our last poll.   As such, here is the poll for the second round of the dragon pin.   https://www.strawpoll.me/15757375  Thank you!\",\n \"Ã‚\\xa0First off - Tengu doodle... because I forgot yesterday. I hadn't had my coffee yet...  Wuh. Things are still moving along amazingly. I've decided to do something a liiiiittttle different for the Koi - in which you have two color choices. I'm using the infamous 'rainbow metal' for these, and soft enamel. This is just a mock-up of color representation:       Ã‚\\xa0Depending on your screen, I feel the dark purple may come out a bit more toward the darker/black spectrum once applied as enamel tends to be slightly darker once painted up.   The rainbow tones thrown in there are just a visual representation. If you search for 'rainbow metal enamel pins' then you will probably get a better idea. Most tend, depending on the linework, etc, to come out in the blue-purple-pink-gold range so I am hoping for a good mix. Each will be unique due to the process, too!   Thank you!\",\n \"Tengu has been unlocked - which also means that while White Kirin won the polls, both White and Black color variations are unlocked!  Once we get about halfway to Nukekubi I'll reveal the Koi pins!   Woo! Thanks all!\",\n \"Ã‚\\xa0I had super fun designing this one. I thought combining the vampric flying head with a Japanese style mask would be far more fun for a design.  As the picture notes, I am looking at putting soft enamel (ie, recessed so it is not flush like hard enamel) in the eyes, under the eyes, and in the mouth to give it a little more of that mask-like effect. If it doesn't work out, then those areas will be hard enamel like the rest.  Thanks guys!\",\n \"Ã‚\\xa0Yay! Another pin unlocked! As such, I have looked at the leader in the first Kitsune round poll - White and Red with Gold finish - and it is now available as a pin you can select!  I have updated the main page with a little 'unlocked' info graphic as well as added a little 'unlocked'. to the main banner image.  Round two voting between Icy/Blue and the Autumn/Orange kitsune pins is a go!  https://www.strawpoll.me/15734689  Once we get about half way to Tengu I will reveal the next pin!\",\n \"I figured I should go ahead and do these 'sealed' social media unlock pins like this since we are rapidly approaching their tiers! While I have not gotten the goal of the social aspect, I still really appreciate everyone who reblogs and retweets the posts I linked on the main campaign page!  Here's Tengu's design mock-up!       For the voting for variants, once Kasa-Obake is unlocked, I will post the new poll with the winner and remaining choices for the next round of your preference vote. As for the main page, I will be adding the little info-graphic of the variant color choices as voting unfolds - perhaps something like 'unlocked' and 'voting now!' type of things, so everyone knows whether their variant choice is locked in yet or not.   As for the next pin's reveal, if we don't reach the social goal, I will do similar to this unlock and provide the design when we are about halfway to Tengu (I hope!).   I'm super excited about Nukekubi's design reveal. I took the 'flying head' concept and mashed it with a demon mask look. One of my fav designs!  As for the visible end of stretch goals, I am thinking about additional items to add to the Kickstarter if funding exceeds the end goal, like a simple add-on pin, or stickers. I'm really curious what taking the line work and making it into a foil or holofoil outline would look like (ie. the bake manekineko line work might look pretty swank in gold or holo) I have made a poll as to stickers if you are interested in them, and what type you may like to see produced.   You can select multiple options:  https://www.strawpoll.me/15726032  This doesn't mean I will make them, it just gives me a good idea of what people want if I do :) (Even then I may be facing the hard choice of a few designs rather than... however many we end up with - ha!)  Thank you for your support!!\",\n 'Ã‚\\xa0Kappa has been unlocked! WOO!  You know the drill ~       Here is the poll for the variants! If they all get unlocked -no worries, but if you have a preference for the one you want to see made most - show it here!  Poll:  https://www.strawpoll.me/15719650  Thanks again everyone!',\n 'Ã‚\\xa0Baku unlocked! Now he can eat all of the bad dreams!  Which means.... here is the mockup for the Kirin color variants.       As before, here is the voting poll for Kirin Variant color choice. Please pick your first choice. If both colors are unlocked, no worries - but in the meantime please place you vote for your favorite of the two!  https://www.strawpoll.me/15710898  Thank you!',\n \"Ã‚\\xa0Woo! Ryuu (Dragon pin, green) has been unlocked. I'm super excited about that.  Additionally, I came to the realization that the Kitsune pin variant that is red (autumn) toned would look way better in copper finish, so that little info graphic on the Kickstarter has been updated.        Here is the mock-up in better size. As such, I will need your vote as to which one you like best! If we blow through all the options in funding then it isn't needed, but in case we don't meet every goal, I'd like to know your  first  choice.  Poll here: https://www.strawpoll.me/15701234  This poll will be active for the remainder of the project - or until (crosses fingers) all are funded - in which case the poll would be a moot point x3  Thank you everyone!\",\n \"Super great to wake up to some friends saying I had made my initial goal - all thanks to you guys!

After all the dropped backers who did not pay within the 7 days Kickstarter allows, it turned out we did not actually make our last stretch goal total. That is very disheartening. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never had so many backers back out at the last minute and then many that did not cancel, just did not end up paying. So when the funds got to me, they were so much less that we did not actually hit Prince Diamond and Neo SerenityÃ¢\\x80\\x99s stretch goal. DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t worry though. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to cover the cost to get that pin made because I said it unlocked and so many people have chosen that design. I just wanted everyone to be aware of it as IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m greatly disheartened by it.   Anyway, on a happier note, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m excited to get all the designs in to the manufacturer.

Why have so many of these building fallen into disrepair? Are they no longer of use? Or simply out of fashion? Ã‚\\xa0     Hawley Brothers, 1880s    The answer in the Western United States starts with the territorial expansion and urbanization that happened in the late 1800s. In California, the extreme growth of the San Francisco Bay Area spurred on rapid industrial growth.     Union Iron Works, 1884    Industrial architects of the time began to build larger, taller structures that could house all operations under one roof, bringing more efficiency. In the mid-1900s, industry slowed and the need for these buildings dissipated. Ã‚\\xa0     New California Sugar Refinery, 1881    Many of these buildings have been torn down to use the space for other needs - offices, housing, warehouses. Some stand unchanged and forlorn. Some have been renovated, revitalized for new purpose. Ã‚\\xa0     Pioneer Varnish Works, 1915    How should we honor these buildings, these material symbols that represent the hard work and challenges of those before us? Do we simply tear down, rebuild, or abandon it, as is the habit of our throw-away culture?Ã‚\\xa0     ---    Or can we take one small piece, breathe new life into it, so that we can say a final thank you before goodbye?

I completely forgot to mention that now that I've switched to these guys rather than my original manufacturer, the size actually ended up being 35mm, not 40mm like I mentioned before!

I did unfortunately run into some problems with my original supplier a while back as they dropped out - but no worries, I've found another one!  The other problem was that I kept going back and forth with the new guys all over again polishing up the design for stability and detail preservation - it's again nothing major, you'd only see these changes if you'd put the pins side-by-side with the original illustration! So that's all good.  The only inconvenience is that these back and forth emails with them caused a delay, which is why I put delays into the Risks and Challenges section - kind of to be expected when dealing with manufacturers! :)  Hopefully it won't be too long now, I'll update you all as soon as I get a notification that the pins are on the way to me!

I\\'m happy to say that the Kickstarter funds have finally come through and I have ordered the pins last night - now we wait!  Some teeny tiny adjustments had to be made to the pins:  - Instead of 35mm, the pins will be sliiiightly bigger at 40mm. This way we get to keep much more detail. I figured that it\\'s not like I\\'m making them smaller, and it does honestly save a LOT of detail, so it seemed like a good decision. I hope you think so, too!  - Some gaps had to be adjusted to be cut out properly or for stability, but those changes are barely noticeable, unless I\\'d put them side by side like a \"find the difference\" game haha.  Other than that, we\\'re still on track!

Ã‚\\xa0They range from serious, to retrospective to downright silly in a H2G2 sort of way. Ã‚\\xa0In this collection is another Sherlock Holmes story called Redeux. Ã‚\\xa0In the dawn of the 23rd century, crime had been eliminated for over 100 years. Ã‚\\xa0Suddenly a new wave of criminal activity starts up and the police don\\'t know how to handle it. Ã‚\\xa0They decide to create an artificial intelligence of the greatest criminal mind the world has ever known to help them understand the purpose behind crime. Ã‚\\xa0They model Moriarty\\'s mind, but it gains sentience and downloads itself into a highly advanced android body and becomes the new crime boss throwing the city into chaos! Ã‚\\xa0Not wanting to risk creating another A.I., the department decides to go back in time and snatch Sherlock Holmes as he\\'s falling from Reichenbach and bring to the future to face off with an old nemesis. Ã‚\\xa0  Also there is another anthology of Holmes stories. Ã‚\\xa0Included in this is a novella, \"The giant rat of Sumatra\". Ã‚\\xa0Six weeks after Holmes and Watson meet, strange sightings appear in London. Ã‚\\xa0Unknown to them, a new criminal mastermind begins building his sydicate in London, having earlier gone to the Island of Doctor Moreau and \"liberating\" one of his early creations, the giant rat. Ã‚\\xa0We see how Holmes became a true inconvienence to his nemesis in his early days.  These will hopefully be coming in the fall of this year and spring of next.

After some very humbling personal messages, Spirit gave me a channeled message intended for a broader audience. So I am sharing it with you!Ã‚\\xa0          \"This world is infinite abundance -- literally! She wants to give you everything your soul needs to embody your purpose! The only scarcity comes from wounded soul aspects within you that cannot conceive of infinite abundance, as lack and limitation is all they have known. But you are not bound by your wounds\\' limitations -- you can choose to see the abundance, and in doing so, you help these parts of you see it too. Know that everything your true heart desires is being brought to you with perfect divine timing.\"    This kinda blew my mind - the message was so clear that the ONLY limitations are what we believe them to be. Change your thinking, change your life. It\\'s really that simple (and yet also so complex, as our wounded beliefs are often also our unconscious ones).Ã‚\\xa0  So there you go - the world is yours to create, as abundantly (or as scarcely!) as your heart desires.Ã‚\\xa0  BIG LOVE to all you CREATORS!  XO',\n \"Now, if you've signed on (or are considering signing on) as a supporter of this project, chances are you fall into one of four categories:   You believe in me (thank you friends, family and clients!).    You believe in the vision (thank you creative supporters!).    You genuinely want to read the book (thank you fans!).    You are an Angel in human form and totally want the true story of Creation to be told (thank you interstellar Light Warriors of Truth!).   ...or perhaps you are all of the above (I know personally that some of you are).  In return for support, in whatever form it appears, I pledge to you that no matter what the status of this project (funded or unfunded), I will write daily until the book is done! And for the duration of this project, I shall post updates about said writing.  Lest you think I am a mere disorganized right-brain creative, writing random interludes as Spirit dictates ( cough ), I give you: SCRIVNER! Ah, the delight of a writing program that allows the left brain to work in tandem with the right:       Ã‚\\xa0As you can tell from the above visual, I have a LOT of writing to do: 76,000 words-worth of writing. If I am to accomplish the first draft in 6 weeks, that's 1809 words PER DAY -- which at the moment is about 2-3 hours of uninterrupted, focused time.Ã‚\\xa0  So kind supporters, I ask again for another form of your support: hold me to my goal! Visualize my success in creating a supportive environment for me to accomplish this vision.Ã‚\\xa0  And please, circulate this project in all of your social networks, as the more visibility, the more possibility of successfully funding it.  Big gratitude!  XO\",\n \"Wonderful supporters of the present and future, thank for going on this journey with me! I want talk a bit about my process, so that you understand why this is both a magical and unusual writing project.  For the past three years, I've been writing about the daily dose of strange that I get in my shamanic work. While these were independent micro-stories at first, in the past 4 months, it has become clear that Spirit has been communicating a much bigger story -- an epic of sorts -- with complicated characters, complexly intersecting plot-lines, and richly rewarding narratives. The amount of detail that I've received is extraordinary, and is far outside of my usual creative process, which is why I attribute it to channeling, rather than a simple act of imagineering on Ã‚\\xa0my part.  As I am an empathic channeler and healer, when I get 'downloads' about the story, I also feel the emotions of the characters. So it feels extraordinarily personal, and very very real. Like an actor, I am able to embody these players and write from their perspectives in very intimate ways.  Now, if I haven't lost you thus far...I invite you to take the blue pill and follow me all the way down the rabbit hole: my Spirit Guides also tell me that in writing this book, and experiencing these emotions as they are conveyed to me, I am also participating in healing the collective traumas described therein.   In fact, we are all sharing the healing by bringing this story into existence, because the telling of it will help shift the collective consciousness from a place of lack to a place of love.    I am aware that is a really audacious claim. But even if you don't believe believe that statement, consider this: the creative process is always healing, both for the individual as well as many of the readers (if well delivered, that is). And therein lies my goal to bring more healing to the world.Ã‚\\xa0  Much gratitude for reading, considering and digesting. I am grateful for your support.  XO\",\n 'One of my morning rituals is a gratitude practice. It\\'s amazing how much the one simple act of giving thanks for all that I have can shift my mood from scarcity-thinking to opening to abundance.Ã‚\\xa0  By way of example: I will admit that I was completely terrified to go public with this novel, as well as with this campaign. It\\'s huge to out myself as a Creator, especially as ... well, as a Marketer, I tend to hide behind others\\' creations. Ã‚\\xa0To tell my story is a much more raw experience.  So yesterday morning, I was feeling all kids of raw. I happened to check my email, and lo, this was the first message I saw:       So of course I am now listening. The email continues, but these were the sentences that really spoke to me:Ã‚\\xa0   Research has shown that writing a personal narrative filled with feelings and perceptions can create long-term health benefits. As you write, remember to have compassion for yourself, particularly when writing about traumatic events.   \"Ah-ha!\" I thought. \"That\\'s why Spirit is being so persistent...there is healing in this. Not just for me, but for a larger audience too.\"  This shift in consciousness made my heart open, and I was filled with gratitude for the message, for the opportunity, and for this crazy thing called human existence.Ã‚\\xa0  Thank you to All My Relations...and that means you, too.

I can't complain when people are reading my unpolished work and helping me turn it into something even better.

Pafu, the ancient red panda spirit also seems to act a little too much like a spoiled teenager sometimes. All my characters work well together, they just need to be more loveable and refined.

Book two in the Ghosts Be Gone series has been outlined in 5,000 words of minimalistic and glorious detail. And that means, that in less than twelve months after the publication of Ghosts Be Gone: Book One, the second in the series should be ready as well.   The story looks promising, and even though I knew what kind of story it would be from an old summary, fleshing it out with an outline really broughtÃ‚\\xa0it to life. Expect more action between espers in book number two!   Stay tuned for more information. And thank you, everyone. As always, you're awesome.\",\n \"You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Of course, I'll be also participating in all that as well Ã¢\\x80\\x94 it is  not  an automated process, but real people (including me).

Here's my sketch:       I will be hiring an illustrator and work with him or her will turn my sketch into something like the example below. (Note: You are NOT receiving a light saber drawing, just to be clear :D). It will be a professionally-rendered technical illustration, complete with call-outs on design and functionality, and printed on art-quality paper.        The final illustration will reflect how Sakima's cuff really is in the novel, when I'm completely done. Right now, the above sketch is how it looks in the book (and in my mind).Ã‚\\xa0  Please tweet and post on any and all of your favorite social media platforms to help get the word out!Ã‚\\xa0  Here's the shortened link: http://bit.ly/kickstrtCITY   Thank you all very much, again.

Best, Thomas More\",\n \"Thank you all again, especially you have pledged in the last couple of days. We have now passed the $900 mark, which is amazing!Ã‚\\xa0       Reaching $900 was also a stretch goal. As a result, the first chapter of Book 2 will be included at the end of  City At My Feet . In addition, I've decided that I'll include the cover for Book 2, as well. How's that sound?  I have to say, I now feel that getting to $1,000 seems very doable! We have just over a week to get there. And when we do (not  if , because you all seem to be able to create magic out there!), everyone gets buttons and bookmarks and Ã¢\\x80\\x94  SURPRISE!

Now let's break through to the other side of $1,000!  Best,  Thomas More, author\",\n \"I only sent out a status just last night saying we were closing in on $800. And today, we've already surpassed that milestone!  We're now into stretch goal territory, and it looks like getting to $900 isn't such a crazy target after all. :D (And if we do, all backers will get the first chapter of Book 2 included at the end of  CITY AT MY FEET ).  Thanks again to everyone who has pledged to this campaign. I am, and will forever be, grateful to you all.  Thomas\",\n \"Hello backers!   Remarkably, we stand just a pledge or two from $800 -- just $38 shy at the moment! This is incredible, thank you so much.Ã‚\\xa0  To celebrate and to encourage others to join the campaign, I've created two stretch goals: one for $900 and another for $1,000.  In case you are unfamiliar with the concept, a stretch goal is an outlandish and unlikely dollar target (inconceivable!). Yet, not impossible. If met, the stretch goal triggers the reward for that goal to be distributed to each and every person, regardless of amount pledged.  For this campaign, we now have a  $900  target where the first chapter of the  Mannahatta Series Book 2: CITY IN MY HANDS  will be included at the end of the first novel that your are currently backing. This will give everyone a glimpse of what is to come next!Ã‚\\xa0  For the  $1,000  target, bookmarks and pins for all! By the way, if you have pledged to receive the ebook, you might want to consider going for the paperback book as well if we start to close in on that elusive $1,000 mark. (Why not get the physical book to match the bookmark?) Also, note that every backer will get 10 bookmarks and 5 pins, to give to friends or keep for yourself.   Thank you again.    And onward!    Thomas More\",\n 'Quick update.  First, we are currently so close to the  $700  milestone, I just know we\\'re going to be there (and surpass it) one of the times I refresh the page (which isn\\'t every five minutes).

Because Kickstarter has tagged us with their coveted \" Projects We Love \" sign, which is an amazing and wonderful thing!Ã‚\\xa0       This means that the  City At My Feet  campaign page will be in front of more eyes than ever and might possibly show up on, wait for it....

And to think I was worried that this campaign might not fund at all! :D       Every dollar still counts, so tell your friends &amp; fam.Ã‚\\xa0  And if you haven't yet pledged, please consider doing so. I have some great ideas for rewards for everyone that I'll announce if we get past $600. (Stretch goals will be for $750 and $1,000. I can't even imagine any dollar target after that just yet!)

Thank you to everyone who's pledged and made this book become a reality! It means a lot to me that this book can now come together in a professional manner and be sent out there for a few others to enjoy! To be able to do something like this as my final major project for uni is just amazing because it's now not just another university project I had to complete, it's something that others will own as well which feels a lot more real and worth it. Ok this is starting to get cringey now so yes, thank you again! It's been a great little start to my path as an illustrator.   What's next?   Ã‚\\xa0In this coming week I'll be working on bringing the illustrations together, adding the text of the story and making it look the best I can before sending it off to the printers. I'll be ordering extra to sell at my end of year degree show and hopefully get round to creating an online shop on my website to also sell them (if I can work out how... I'll get there eventually).Ã‚\\xa0  I will be updating soon in terms of surveys and getting your details so I can send you the books and any rewards you've pledged for as well.   Something extra?   A little idea in the back of my head that's slowly consuming me is the possibility of creating a dust jacket/ book wrap for the books itself. I'm definitely going to look into it at least and I'll update in the future of my findings and whether it'll go ahead or not. Not going to lie, I'm a bit obsessed with that soft-touch lamination you get on some other books these days (you know, the really soft satin-y rubbery matte feel) and that's kind of what I want to produce for the books, but we'll see!

So thank you, it means a lot!Ã‚\\xa0   Update on progress:   I will continue to crack on with the illustrations, I'm so very nearly there now in terms of initial completion. I will definitely have all the illustrations finalised and ready to become a book by the end of the funding period. By that point, all that will be left is the last tweaks to the typography and final overall technical checks, then it should be ready to begin its printing journey!

I don't plan on just scanning and throwing them all together willy-nilly, I've got some real good ideas and I hope you'll enjoy it as an all-in-one remembrance of this fun little Kickstarter.  That's about it, now it's just coasting to the finish line... I hope we pick up a couple more friends by the end of these five days, but if not, that's totally cool too. This idea has grown so much more than I ever expected and I hope you all will love your letters as much as I'll love writing them!Ã‚\\xa0  &lt;3 -Will-\",\n 'Hey everyone!  We\\'re still growing slowly and my excitement keeps building! Just wanted to extend another quick thank you to all the backers.  One more thing, I have made a decision on the collection of letters book idea from the last update. Instead of setting up a whole other kickstarter (which, honestly, felt a little greedy on my end) I decided that every backer here will get the link to the completed pdf e-book of the letters when it\\'s all put together for FREE!       So, not only will you get your personal letter, but you\\'ll also get the link to \"A Letter, for you. The E-Book\", all for your dollar!  There will be an added question on the backer surveys asking your permission to use your letter in the e-book. This way if you want to keep it personal between you and I, you can tell me.  That\\'s all I got for now, only 12 days to go and so many letters to write, thank you all again for backing and sharing!  &lt;3Ã‚\\xa0  -Will-Ã‚\\xa0',\n 'IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m so excited to get to work on everyoneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s letters that I just went ahead a bought some supplies ahead of time! The project has seemed to hit a plateau with backers, which I expected after that rush when it launched, and I still canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe we got as high as we did! Still so much time left but I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wait to get going!!  My wife and I have been talking a lot about the project and how it had such a positive response from so many people. The simplicity of just getting a letter in the mail has been lost to so many nowadays and I hope that this produces a small but positive impact on all of you. (And maybe IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll get a few pen pals out of it Ã°\\x9f\\x98\\x81)  IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been thinking on what kind of order I will attempt on sending the letters. My first thought is to just go in Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbackerÃ¢\\x80\\x9d order from oldest to newest but, since this is my first KS, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not sure how long it takes to get everyoneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s backer survey in. I guess IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m just going to have to play it by ear. I also know that I will be photo-copying each letter I send to gather together into a small memory book for myself. My question for you though is, would this be something you guys would be interested in purchasing in the future?(Obviously with your personal information omitted) Perhaps Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA Letter, For You.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Kickstarted small print run?? Let me know what you think, and as always thank you all for being so awesome!  Much love, -Will-',\n \"(me right now)     I woke up this morning secretly hoping, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccould we actually pass $100 on this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã‚\\xa0In the beginning it seemed ridiculous, I told myself IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be lucky to hit the goal of $20... But apparently, it wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t ridiculous, in fact, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not only surpassed $100... we hit $200!!!  That's freaking amazing!! I cannot thank you guys enough for your generosity and excitement for my fun little project! This is more than I ever thought it would be and I'm so excited to start writing everyone's letters!Ã‚\\xa0  Feel free to share the project on your preferred social media!  Two hundred! Wow....I'm gonna have to find some fancier paper :)  &lt;3 Ã‚\\xa0-Will-\",\n \"Wow! Thanks guys!  Now I know my goal wasn't huge but being funded in less than an hour really means something special to me! I'm so glad other people miss proper letters as much as I do.  And to make it even better, the first two backers are international!! That's crazy exciting!!! I cannot wait to start working on everyone's letters!  Thank you friends! Much love to all of you!\",\n 'Ã‚Â¡Muchas gracias a todos, porque sin ustedes esto no podrÃƒ\\xada haber sido posible! Gracias a todo el apoyo  Historia de Aos I.

If you've missed it, drop me a message and if it's still not too late I'll see what I can do.Ã‚\\xa0  Thank you to all those who have taken part in the print option! By a small majority, we're going with two A5 prints. Below are the pictures I'll include in your pack :) I hope you like them!Ã‚\\xa0       The bookmarks are with the printer as we speak - and soon the book will be as well. I'll keep you all posted as to how things are going.  Until next time!  Russ\",\n \"Hello everyone! Whilst I wait for Kickstarter to release the funds into my bank account I've been doing some research about prints. Bookmarks are designed and ready to go. I think we have enough to get you all a print (or two).  So....here's the question.Ã‚\\xa0  Would you rather have one A4 print, or two A5 prints? You'd have to cut the A5 prints yourself (the local printer would charge more for that) so if you wanted A5 prints, they would come on one piece of A4 card.  This link should take you to a very quick survey. From there, I can work out what is the most popular choice and we'll take it from there.   https://forms.gle/Jj9MoK3QeMy3fqSw7Ã‚\\xa0   Cheers!  Russ\",\n \"Some good news, some bad news.Ã‚\\xa0  The good news! The funds are now in - just waiting for the bank to clear them and I'm all set. My good friend and designer friend is almost done with the layout, and I'm proof-reading as we speak. I'm planning on going to the printer next week and we should get the books about two weeks after.  The bad news. A couple of backers dropped at the last minute. This is not a big problem. The books will most certainly go ahead as planned - with the full 15 stories. I'm going to have to re-think the bookmarks though. With this being a small project, alas every backer counted and with two backers dropping, it has altered figures. We'll see. Leave it with me and we'll get something sorted I'm sure.  If you've not already done the survey about whether or not you want your name listed, I'll be closing it in the next few days - so if you want your name included, fill that survey in as quickly as you can!  As ever, any questions, just give me a shout......  Cheers!  Russell\",\n \"Hi everyone,  Things are moving on. We're still waiting on a couple of backers to get their payment sorted out, but everything should be progressing smoothly.  As a bit of a thank you, I thought it might be nice to list all the backers of the Kickstarter in the book. I'm aware that some of you might not want your name listed so I've sent you all a message with a short survey. If you could fill that in, letting me know if you want your name listed and what name you'd like me to use, that would be great.Ã‚\\xa0  If you DON'T fill the survey in, that's fine but I will have to assume you DON'T want your name listed in the book.Ã‚\\xa0  I hope that makes sense!  Speak soon,  Russell\",\n \"Hey everyone, we've finally made it! Thank you everyone - I'm so overwhelmed by the support you have given. We've managed to unlock a total of 5 extra stories, giving you a whopping 15 stories as my way of saying thanks. Everyone who backed the paperback and hardback will also be getting a bookmark snuck in there. Alas we didn't reach any prints, which is a shame, but such is life. I hope this book will give you much pleasure..  What happens next? I've sent out a quick survey to physical backers about signing the book or not. You should also be asked soon to pay by Kickstarter. The sooner this happens, the sooner they can process the funds. As soon as I get the funds, I can then liaise with the printer and get that rolling.Ã‚\\xa0  Time scales? Kickstarter normally takes about 2 weeks to process funds - that will take us close to the last week of April. Printing should take less than a month once proofs have been sorted and all that. So all going well, I hope to have the books in the post middle of May. I can't see any massive delays so books should start arriving not long after that.Ã‚\\xa0  Time scales?

Russ\",\n \"Hi everyone,  We're in the last few days, and then it's time for me to get busy!Ã‚\\xa0  I'm posting this update because I've had a few people ask me if I would sign their book, and how much this would cost. If you want the book signing, I'm happy to do this for free. When it comes to collecting information from you, I'll put something in there to ask if you want it signed or not - just let me know :)  I'll be in touch in the next few days with more details as they come. Until then,  Russ out\",\n \"Hi everyone,  Thanks to  Lorraine  for pledging last night, everyone who has backed the physical rewards will now get a snazzy bookmark as well. Cheers!  We're in the last few days. I'm starting to work on the story order and I think I've got it just right now. The printer has been in touch, and he's all ready to start printing at the end of the month. This means Ã‚\\xa0I should get the books the first week in May (unless something goes wrong) and then it's just a matter of shipping them out.  If by some miracle we reach Ã‚Â£900 and beyond, I'll start enquiring about prints. It's never too late to share the project should you want to help us reach that target - and you might even get a nice print (or two) to boot!  Until next update,Ã‚\\xa0  RUssell\",\n \"Hey everyone,Ã‚\\xa0  And so we enter the last week. Funding continues to trickle in, but I lost a backer which was a bit of a blow when it's such a small scale project. No matter! We're still on-track for the books and the book marks.  A bit hush hush, but as a thank you to you guys I've decided to include 2 more stories, making it a total of 15. I can't go into details so hopefully it'll come as a nice surprise when you get the book...  Lastly, I've updated the Project to show some possible prints if by some miracle funding rockets up in these last few days :)  All the best for now,  Russell\",\n \"As promised, I've updated the project. One bookmark will be given to all backers of physical rewards if we get to Ã‚Â£800. See Project Details for a preview.  Tell your friends! You NEED that bookmarks :)\",\n 'Hi all,  Just checking in to say weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve now unlocked all thirteen stories...wooo!  So what next? I want to get some art prints out to all those who have backed the physical rewards. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to make some calls tomorrow and find out costs etc. Once IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got this information, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be able to work out the logistics. My idea is to provide at least 4, maybe 5 prints of pictures that relate to some of the stories in the book. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m currently working on the art work so letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s see what happens. Of course, I may be getting ahead of myself. With just over two weeks, anything could happen.  If any of you have any ideas, suggestions for the next stretch goal IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m all ears! Just give me a shout and we can move things forward.  Right, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s it from me! Remember, sharing the project increases the chances of more backers. More backers = more goodies :)  Until next time,  Russ',\n \"Hello everyone!  Woke up to the great news we've unlocked another story - thank you Kyle for pushing us over that barrier :)  One more story to go, and then we can discuss art options. I was originally thinking of some A5 art prints - ideally to represent some of the stories. Maybe look into bookmarks? I don't want to get ahead of myself though, so one step at a time.  So let me know what you think though regarding stretch goals. Happy to take onboard any ideas!  Russ\",\n \"Hi everyone,  The first week is over, and like most Kickstarters the funding starts to slow down. This is my 4th Kickstarter, and it's always the same. No biggy, we've got the funds and we've unlocked one extra story. Support is still coming in, so we should be able to unlock the other stories as well.  I've updated the project blurb. I had stupidly called this an anthology when it's actually a collection - oops!Ã‚\\xa0  So....if you wanted to share this project with your friends, families, pets, that would be smashing. I think there's links to share the project on the home page to the obvious places like Facebook and Twitter as well as the option to copy the link. The more shares we do, the more chances we have of getting more backers. The more backers, the more goodies for everyone!  That's about all I've got for now. If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, feel free to post/shout and I'll get back to you ASAP.  Russ out\",\n \"Great news everyone! We've reached our first stretch goal, thanks to Julien so that's 11 stories. I've updated the project page to illustrate how the stretch goals will work. I might have to tweak things as we go along, but we'll go with that for now.Ã‚\\xa0  You'll see I've talked about artwork. For all physical backers, I plan on producing some lovely mini-art prints. These will be A5 in size, printed on a beautiful art silk board paper, and be related to the stories in the anthology. Just how many pictures will all depend on the project I guess so we'll play it by ear. Any questions, fire away :)\",\n 'Hey everyone!  I thought IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d give a quick update with how the project is going.  So far, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s going very well - weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve reached and passed the target goal which is brilliant! When I get to my computer later on, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll calculate costs and what not and try to work out about stretch goals. At the moment, the book contains 10 stories. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m hoping to squeeze at least 3 more in there.  At a rough estimate I reckon for every Ã‚Â£50 to Ã‚Â£75 extra we can get an extra story....but when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done my sums, this has to be Ã‚Â£50 to Ã‚Â£75 extra in terms of profit - not just pledge if that makes sense. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not in this to make money, but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure you appreciate I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to lose money!!  Anyway, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m very confident we will get at least 13 stories in the book. From there, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got a few more ideas planned but I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to jinx things so letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s talk about that when we get there.  In the meantime, it would be great if you could share this project with your friends, colleagues, family, dentists, anyone who might like a good story or two.  Any questions, just ask away!  Russell',\n \"Well that was exciting! Thank you all for backing - we've reached our target in under 24 hours.Ã‚\\xa0  So what next?  Stretch goals!!  My plan is to add more stories the more backers we get. We're currently just over Ã‚Â£10 the target. I propose for every, say, Ã‚Â£50 to Ã‚Â£75 over I add another story to the collection. Sound fair? Let me know what you think - I'm always up for ideas :)  And now, I'm going to have a little lie down....\",\n \"Thank you all so much. I'm shocked and happy with how fast my goal was met.

Just a really quick update. I'm just putting the final touches on the ebook and it will be posted before midnight. Ã‚\\xa0\",\n 'It\\'s Saturday! And that means we are leaving the Big Apple. We\\'ve had a great (but tiring) couple of days here. On the recoding front, we are just about 1/2 way through. We\\'ll be monitoring the rest of the book from our cabin in Luray via telephone starting Monday. Not as fun as \"being there\" but the New York pace is a hectic one and Robin and I are old people and need to get back to our peaceful surroundings.  Last night, while having drinks and some great  guacamole (recipe found here)  with Margot Atwood--no not that Margot Atwood, this one works at Kickstarter in the publishing division and we\\'ve known her for years--we found out that we reached our next stretch goal! What\\'s amazing about this is while we\\'ve had some really great Kickstarters in the past, this one moves to the top of for most-funded of all our projects. Again, our eternal thank you to everyone. There really is only one more goal to reach....well, two, but I don\\'t think we\\'ll meet that so I won\\'t even speak it\\'s name unless we get close...but I digress. The only record we haven\\'t broken with regards to our other projects is # of backers.  So, a new stretch goal has been set and this time it\\'s not about the money it\\'s to see if we can get more people to back this project than backed The Disappearance of Winter\\'s Daughter. That will require 2,076 backers (282 people) and we have 10 days to go. That\\'s ambitious, but doable. We\\'ll see what happens.  Well, we have to get packed and head for Penn Station, I\\'ll leave you with this photo, taken as we were leaving the studio. It includes Brooke (the engineer who keeps Tim on his toes), Tim, and, of course, myself. Ã‚\\xa0We\\'ll be tuning in again once we are back in Luray.',\n 'Hey all, and hello from chilly New York. (It\\'s about 20 degrees here)       In about an hour we\\'ll start recording the audio version of Age of Legend with Tim Gerard Reynolds! Ã‚\\xa0Last night we had a great dinner (and chat) with one of our audio publishers, and tonight Tim, Robin, and I, are going to be hanging out together.  As for the Kickstarter, things continue to go well, although it has cooled a bit, which they usually do about this time. We are one week in, and we have two weeks to go.  I want everyone to put their thinking caps on, because we\\'re going to play a little game. It\\'s called, guess that final funding! Ã‚\\xa0Robin is having a 1,000-piece puzzle of Magna made up. Ã‚\\xa0It looks like this:       She\\'s going to put up a survey and the one who comes the closest to guessing what the final funding level will be, will win this one-of-a-kind special puzzle. Actually, it\\'ll be two-of-a-kind, because she\\'s going to make one for us as well. Ã‚\\xa0We\\'re going to cut off guesses a week before the Kickstarter ends, and you can revise your guess as we progress along. (Whatever you enter last will be your \"official\" guess). This contest will be open to all people, even those outside the Kickstarter.  If you want some help with the guesses, there is something called KickTraq. And one of the things it does is estimates final funding       Currently it\\'s predicting between  87,977 and 119,003 . I think both of those are ridiculously high, but we\\'ll see!  In other news, we are inching toward the next stretch goal, and again, Robin will be putting up something new tonight when we get back to the hotel.

Obviously none of you backers need to buy it, but if you enjoyed the book, and if you can, mention it on Twitter or Facebook, or to friends. Anyone who might like sci-fi. Maybe Tweet it to book critics or scientists who enjoy \"hard science\" narratives? I read on news websites about, like,  15 year olds writing books that end up as best sellers and getting Netflix deals ? But I literally just cannot fathom how this happens. Who do you need to kidnap and blackmail to get that kind of traction? Or that  Potato Salad Kickstarter guy , who got given money just to make himself some salad?Ã‚\\xa0  So by all that logic, it should be  totally super easy  to make this book  crazy mega successful . Right? Exactly!Ã‚\\xa0  It\\'s set at (nearly) the same price as the Kickstarter was, just 99p. However, you guys got three types of file, whereas Amazon customers will only get a Mobi file. So I think you got the cooler deal because you helped fund it.  The print version will be available in about a week, for the price of Ã‚Â£3. But really I\\'m hoping people buy the Kindle edition and this will spread across the internet. I make 29 pennies per each sale of the Kindle edition. So if it sells like 100\\'000 copies, that\\'s not bad.   For disclosure:  I will be activating a promotion for people to download a free copy in about a month or so. Kindle allows you to set this promotion, to generate interest. So around the middle to end of May, I\\'m going to make it available for free, for 5 days in a row. Maybe even in June? I\\'m hoping people really start mentioning it online at that point, because who can argue with free stuff? I will make another update when that happens. Really, I just want people to read my work.',\n \".    Since I'm doing this whole project myself, I also painted the cover.  I'm currently working on getting the Kindle version on Amazon, while the print copy will follow in a week or so.  Sadly due to the way the print pricing works, the lowest I can price the UK version is Ã‚Â£3, which nets me a whole 9 pennies! But I figured no one would pay more than Ã‚Â£3 for such a short story, no matter how awesome the cover was.Ã‚\\xa0  Once it goes on sale I will make another update and hopefully word can spread and this can go viral.  It was done in wax pastels, then finished up in coloured inks and water colours, then digitally manipulated.\",\n 'ONLY FOR BACKERS',\n 'ONLY FOR BACKERS',\n 'ONLY FOR BACKERS',\n 'ONLY FOR BACKERS',\n \"There are 4 hours to go before this ends, so I don't expect too much activity, but I can safely say we've done it. We are over the goal so this will get written.  I continue to make notes. I have a general outline of the first 75% of the story - I just need to envision the end of the quest.  Tomorrow (Monday) I've got some errands to run, but otherwise on Tuesday I will throw myself into completing the saga full-time.Ã‚\\xa0  It's safe to say this will be delivered well before the estimated delivery time. I want to say... Before the end of April? Certainly before the middle of May, since I have a different unrelated project starting then.  Since the overall word length for this will be quite short, below 10'000 words, I'd like to end it with the possibility for sequels. Not a cliff hanger - not with unfinished business or unanswered questions, but more a case of: we learned something new, attained new skills and equipment, so we're ready to go on another adventure somewhere new. As such I've been thinking of the main cast not as disposable, but as an ensemble with great potential.  However, I still maintain my goal of writing something which is basically pure trashy entertainment.  After it's been delivered to everyone digitally, at some point, I will paint a really awful watercolour cover and drop this on Amazon, to see if it gets any sales.

For the backers that haven't yet gotten their books -- AKA many of those who told me they did not need theirs by April 20th -- those copies will be shipped out this week. Thanks for your patience. And I hope all of you who got yours in time for Passover have loved them as much as I expect you to.   I repeat, however:  I cannot send you your book unless you reply to the survey I sent out earlier this month. Kickstarter gives me precious little details other than an email address. So if you want me to mail the book to you, please reply to that survey.  We are finally all set for the SF launch event at The Academy on May 4th. It's going to be a Saturday dinner on the patio in the Castro neighborhood. The dinner is $60 (+$5 ticket tax and fee) and is a catered event by Wise Sons with matzo ball soup and brisket, and wine and cocktails. And it'll be hosted by me (of course).  To buy a ticket for the event via Facebook: go  here .  Or to buy it on Eventbrite (they're the same thing, but just so you have options): go  here .  For the 5 or so backers who bought the highest reward on Kickstarter: For you, the dinner is  free,  with a 20 percent discount on anyone you'd like to bring as a +1.

Neil Patrick Harris messaged a few days ago requesting a copy of the book. This wasn't the first time someone claimed to be part of his camp, so at first I was like sure, Jan:       But it turns out it was actually him, or at least -- accounting for the fact that this is still the Internet, so still a little margin of error -- I'm mostly sure it is now. :-) That's great! Thank you for your interest NPH! I just hope you like the book; I sent along a few copies just yesterday.  I also sent out an estimated 60 or so other copies from backers who replied wanting them ASAP. Kickstarter hangs on to project funds for two weeks after the campaign ends, so I haven't seen a cent of the campaign money yet. All the illustration costs, proofing, book development, and printing I've paid upfront with my own funds. So you can imagine, money is kinda tight around these parts right now! I should get the disbursement in a few days to a week, and I will start shipping out the rest of these booklets latest beginning this Wednesday.

I'm going to do a bit of an extended PR push this coming week just to see how far I can kick this little project down the road.  And there still is a launch event planned on May 4th with The Academy in SF. The details are going to go live this Monday - or that's the plan! If you want to attend, it'll be a dinner.

Thank you for enjoying my art. Thank you for supporting it. The act of buying and consuming is so whetted in our culture and daily lives that it\\'s easy to see the small sums spent on this project as just another day in the life. But supporting this book really meant helping me live more authentically as me than I think I ever have in previous times in my life. So thank you, again.  This little book is 46 pages, and I thought it would come together so seamlessly. The story I had written in 2015, and what struggle really was it to add in recipes, some songs and games, a \"gayder plate\" and a few other things? A lot, apparently.Ã‚\\xa0  The content production was honestly not so difficult, but deciding every element of layout was a lot: figuring out page order, paragraph styles, fonts, boxes, image sizes, bleeds, all of it. Then came the adaptation process: making sure all the images were the right DPI, and resizing layouts to match the printer\\'s specifications. I probably had to do this three or four times. Then I had to generate files of a gigabyte or more, and I had to meet some fairly strict deadlines to make sure people got these books if they needed them by Passover.Ã‚\\xa0  And then,  marketing . Direct messaging people every day. Sending press releases. Writing Facebook posts. Answering messages. I actually think this project had a fair amount more sale potential, but I had to stop promoting it to finish its production.  I think the final result speaks for itself. It\\'s just a little thing, but it is beautiful, and funny, and from the heart.                      For those of you following these updates: a survey will go out in the next day to get your mailing address.

We have the cover. I'll have the edits back from the editor in a couple of days.  With seven days to go, we just crossed the $2,000 mark. This is awesome, as it's double the original funding goal. The extra money is enough to cover most of the deposit of a professional audio production, but won't cover the full cost. I listen to audio books in the car all the time. I love them. I also love hearing a skilled actor bring my words to life. It's the next best thing to seeing it on a movie screen. (If you've listened to my books on audio, you know what I'm talking about.)  If we can fund the audio book now, everybody who backs this project will get a copy, and it will happen  much  sooner. If we can't, I have to look at other options and that will push the production several months down the road.  You've already done an amazing thing by contributing to this project.

I doubt it's a Kickstarter record, but it certainly is for me.  And it's all thanks to you generous people. I am so grateful to all of you.  But I can hardly relax yet.  Next step, let's see if we can fund the audio book, too. Audio book production is expensive when you're dealing with professional voice actors, but you also get what you pay for. Talent mixed with audio production expertise doesn't come cheap.  If we can hit $3,500, that will be enough to fund the audio book production. That will be our only Stretch Goal.

The cover wasn't bright or rich enough and the cover was more yellowed compared to the dust cover.Ã‚\\xa0  Still, it was great to hold the dummy (lower left) in my hands a sense how the finished book will feel. Also, the images on the interior pages look AWESOME.        So I fixed the files and the new proofs came in yesterday. They look perfect!

The first is that even though we didn't hit out full-color stretch goal, I've decided to include a postcard of Penny Peacock with every hardcover book purchased in this Kickstarter!       Also, to give the book an extra premium feel, I've designed these end pages (The first pages you see when you lift either side of the cover).

Well, back when I was attending a university with no animation program, Nate and I became good friends and we started a group to create animation content. Many participants came and went, but Nathan and I were the two who stayed ... until ... Nate went into Pharmaceuticals. For quite awhile, Nathan was the pharmacist who dreamed of telling his stories. He was an enthusiastic supporter of my animation career and we became close friends. Then for the last few years, Nathan has been living that dream. He\\'s an inspiration to me and it\\'s a great pleasure to run our Kickstarters together!  Check out his project,  Nellybug 2: Mystery of the Shadow Frost  below.

One week on Kickstarter, and we\\'re only around $300 from hitting the minimum goal, thanks to all of you WONDERFUL people. THANKS!!!!!!!!  As today\\'s celebratory event, here is the song I composed for the \"credits\" of the film pitch!                            While the song was written and performed by myself, the real talent at work here was my good friend Joseph Limb. After we recorded the piano, he spent weeks orchestrating the piece and truly bringing my vision to life.Ã‚\\xa0  This song was so vocally challenging, that recording this song was one of the most emotionally taxing things I\\'ve ever done. Joseph was extremely encouraging and patient as well pieced together a solid performance. (Yes, if you read between the lines there, I couldn\\'t even sing the song through once without taking a break ). Despite my worries, I\\'m impressed with the work he has done here. And I really hope Joseph, who is one of the most hard-working people I know, has great success soon!

Enjoy your weekends,  - The Samurai Sheepdog Team\",\n \"Hey all,  Just wanted to keep you updated to let you know that we have received funds. As soon as I'm back on my feet (recovering from the flu), I will send out surveys as well as codes for copies of the book. Keep an eye on your emails the next couple days.  - Kevin\",\n \"It got a little shaky there toward the end, but we've done it. We have funded.  What's Next?  We're working diligently to finish the last piece of the print setup to send for a proof copy. Once we receive our funds for the project, we will send out your ebooks. I will also continue to provide updates on the RPG progress as we progress into the next few months.  Thank you everybody, and have a good evening. I'll be back once we send out for the print proof, and if you have any questions in the meantime, I'll be happy to field them.\",\n 'Great news everybody, we have funded!  Thank you all for your support on this project. We look forward to getting everything completed and sent to you once the campaign ends in 3 days and we receive the funds soon after. Between now and then, we can keep working toward new stretch goals.  - Kevin',\n \"We are so close to funding, everybody. I'm very excited for how far we've come, and I can only hope that we'll see another uptick in backers before Friday at 6:00 pm. I have another story preview set for tomorrow, so keep an eye out for that, and a final preview on Friday.

Have a good week everybody.  - The Samurai Sheepdog Team\",\n 'Hello everybody,  We are moving into our final week for this project. It\\'s time to kick things up to 11 so that we can fund and shoot for a stretch goal or two.  For starters, we\\'re meeting with  The Awakened  creator Hal Greenberg tomorrow. During our hangout, we\\'ll learn more about the world of Grimaton and the Isle of Bones\\' place within it. We\\'ll also get his ideas for where  The Awakened  might be headed next. Finally, we\\'ll discuss the story Hal wrote with Andrew and Monica Marlowe, titled \"Autumn in Briarstraid.\"  Speaking of Hal\\'s Story  Here\\'s a look at one of the main characters, who also features on the cover of \\'The Isle of Bones;\\' Halifax Stormcaller.',\n \"Good afternoon all,  Just checking in to remind you that the Marlowe House twitch channel will be discussing the project tonight at 7:00 PM EST with Hal Greenberg. Here's a link to their page.   Marlowe House on Twitch          We hope to see a few of you tonight. I'll be back on Thursday to share another look at the RPG progress we're making.

Meeting William Kenyon  Tomorrow, we\\'re jumping back on for lunch at 12:30 pm EST with William Kenyon to talk about his story, \"Civilized Orcs.\" As I\\'m sure you can expect now, you\\'ll find a preview of that story here. Enjoy and we\\'ll see you tomorrow.',\n 'Great morning everybody,  I want to start off by thanking all of you for helping us to reach our goal of $990. Don\\'t see it yet? That is because one of our close friends has reached out that he has been saving up to bring us to our goal in time, but has not yet been able to do so. Since we can vouch for his good status, we\\'re not going to punish the project just because it isn\\'t there yet and have worked it out to ensure we get hard cover copies of the Isle of Bones for those of you who would like them.  Want More than a Code?  A couple of you have reached out about the print on demand codes and made it clear that you would rather just pay to have us ship the book to you ourselves to avoid any hassle with ordering and such. We hear you, so going forward, we\\'re offering the option to order the hard cover copy of \\'Isle of Bones\\' and have us ship it for you. This means you\\'ll need to give us your shipping information once we send out surveys, but other than that, you can sleep comfortably knowing that the book will be on its way soon after we get the proof approved. This added processing includes shipping for a total of $8 and can be chosen easily by either updating your pledge to Gnomish Shipping Captain or (for Orcish Bards and above) as an $8 addon ($16 if you also want us to ship the RPG when it\\'s finished).  This doesn\\'t change  Awakened Scouts  who still want their code for the lower cost. You will still receive a hard cover copy of \\'Isle of Bones\\'.  Meeting Sam Berry  We\\'re going to enjoy our coffee with Sam Berry  tomorrow morning at 9:00 am EST , and we\\'d love to have you join us. We\\'ll discuss our progress with the project so far and Sam\\'s story, \"Double-Edged Words.\" Here\\'s a preview to get you prepared.',\n 'Whether you celebrate the holiday today or not, we have a fun gift for you, previewing \"Autumn\\'s in Briarstraid,\" by Hal Greenberg, Andrew Marlowe, and Monica Marlowe. Enjoy!',\n \"It's been a good week here, and it's about to get even better because we have a preview of what we're planning for our backers at the Orcish Bard level and above. Namely, the awakened necromancer.     Spellcasting as some fantasy buffs know it is greatly diminished on Grimaton, which is what makes awakened so dangerous in the eyes of some.    This is a look at the actual RPG campaign book. We also have the rules ready for awakened necromancers who want to play in their own world, a'la  The Book of Many Things . I'll share a look at that content exclusively with Orcish Bards and above as we get closer to the end of the campaign.  Meeting Jonathan, Sam, and Will  In addition to  tonight's hangout  with  Jonathon M. Thompson  of Battlefield Press at  7:00 pm EST , we have 2 more meets scheduled now. One for  Saturday morning at 9:00 am EST  (bring your favorite breakfast and beverage of choice) with  Sam Berry . The other is on  Sunday afternoon at 12:30 pm EST  (let's do lunch!) with  William Kenyon . As with our previous hangouts, we'll ask some questions and get an idea of each author's content/writing process. All in about 15-30 minutes.  We'll see you tonight. If you have any questions about the preview above, let us know and we'll be happy to field them.  - The Samurai Sheepdog Team\",\n 'Good morning everybody,   Our next Kickstarter Live stream is scheduled for tomorrow at 7pm.  This time, we\\'re meeting up with Jonathan M. Thompson to discuss his story, \"Hibernation\\'s Den.\" We\\'ll also learn a little more about Jonathan, his writing methods, and what he found most interesting about writing for  The Awakened.   As with our previous hangouts, here\\'s a quick look at Jonathan\\'s story from Isle of Bones.',\n \"With all 5 of our custom character requests now taken, we've already heard that there could be more people hoping to be included in  The Awakened RPG  we're working on for later this year. To give them that opportunity, we have created the Isle of Bones Hero reward.       This tier is technically only $10 more than Isle of Bones Emissary, but we're going to ask that you plan for a piece of character art because we will likely be replacing something we're already working on to include it.  We're over 50% complete now (Hoorah!), with just over 5 days left to reach 75% ($990) and guarantee hard cover copies of the print on demand book.\",\n 'Come watch us hang out with Christopher Yono as we discuss his story, \"As the Arrow Flies.\"   Good morning everybody,  We\\'re starting this weekend out at almost $600 once again. Still working hard to reach that 75% (around $990) goal by next Friday.  We mentioned  The Awakened Modern  during our meet up. I\\'m told it is actually Hal Greenberg\\'s story in that book that has a gorilla companion awakened to an unexpecting college student. Sounds like quite the story.  I\\'ll check back in as we draw closer to our next hang out with Jonathan M Thompson on Wednesday at 7:00PM EST. If you have any questions or comments in the meantime, I\\'ll be watching for them.  Have a good weekend all,  0 Kevin',\n 'In case you couldn\\'t make it to the Live stream,  Check out our hang out last night with author A.L. Cholerton.   We have another coming up on Saturday at 11 AM EST to help include anybody in different timezones. This time around, we\\'ll meet up with Christopher Yono, author of \"As the Arrow Flies.\" As with Amy\\'s, the hang out will last between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on any additional questions. Here\\'s a look at Christopher\\'s story to help psyche you up for our meet tomorrow.       Speaking of Questions  We had one last night about the chance to pick up more than one copy of the book later. Once the Kickstarter is complete, we will offer the book on Amazon and Drivethru Fiction for starters, but the best way to get it at a discount is through here. Hope that helps.',\n \"Hi all,  Just wanted to pop in to remind you that we're setting up for a Kickstarter Live meeting with A.L. Cholerton tonight at 7pm EST. Feel free to join us as we ask some project-related questions and get to know her better.  Watching for any comments/questions through the email messenger when they come through, but I'm going to be a little quiet today otherwise, as I'm fairly unexpectedly busy in a good way.  See you tonight!  - Kevin\",\n \"It's so beautiful that I could cry.  And actually did cry.Ã‚\\xa0  My book is becoming  so real.   And the cover artist  Anndr  is so incredibly talented. They knew exactly what to do and the little details on this image are just astounding.     The full wraparound paperback cover (front, back, and spine)    I can't upload a super high-quality image to Kickstarter so I thought I'd zoom in on some of my favourite details. I really can't get over how perfect it is.     little bodies all dark and stacked in shelves!       skull wrist charm!       The detail on her hair is just STUNNING       The darksight spell on her eyes! Look! LOOK AT IT!    I am so overwhelmed by how perfect this cover is. How professional it is. How true to my image for BOOKS &amp; BONE. I never could have afforded this without your help. Thank you. Thank you so much!  Ebook formatting and paperback typesetting are going well and moving at a good pace. It really looks like I'm going to be able to get this published and out into the world by the intended date -- and earlier for you! Which ... seems insane? This is the first book I've ever published and I've had to learn so many new things to get to this point, but it really is all going to plan.  I'm excited to show you whatever comes next. Which I think will be proof copies? Just the idea of holding this book in my hands makes me feel kind of dizzy!  Talk soon.  With love and awkwardness,  Victoria\",\n \"I can't believe there's less than Ã‚Â£50 before I can afford the ISBNs! You have all been so amazing. It's really looking possible right now and I'm so extremely grateful to you.  I didn't get time for microfiction today so that'll come tomorrow instead. I wanted to share this picture, though. My partner brought home this homunculus and now my house is haunted     Picture does not accurately depict the creepiness of this object / creature    Fingers-crossed tomorrow will go well and BOOKS &amp; BONE will reach Ã‚Â£1000!   With love and awkwardness,  Victoria\",\n \"I'm very excited to be in talks with the artist right now, sending references and discussing things like atmosphere and lighting and oh my goodness I can't wait until there's something to look at.  I don't yet have anything to share from that regard, but I have put together the covers for the short story ebooks! While they are not anywhere near as exciting as the book cover, and they have been put together by me (I'm not an artist but I  am  free), I'd still like to share them with you and I think they'll hold up okay considering they're just for the supporting stories.  (I tried to post them to kickstarter but it won't accept image uploads? Here are the links instead)   Familiar &amp; Flame Ã‚\\xa0   Tinker &amp; Terror   ... I did the best I could. Luckily I write better than I art, and the excellent Anna Pazyniuk is handling the cover for BOOKS &amp; BONE.  Anyway! Tomorrow I'll be writing a bunch of microfiction on Mastodon with a magical theme in support of this campaign. Feel free to check it out -- I'm vicorva@tootplanet.space. I'll write it up when I'm done and share it here for anyone who'd prefer that!  Okay. On to Day 28  With love and awkwardness,  Victoria\",\n \"We're almost done! I nervously await the email from Kickstarter every morning that tells me the progress, if any, that this campaign is made. The numbers are so close but there's so little time left! I'm still pushing on but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little apprehensive.  I'm reminding myself that whether the next stretch goal is reached or not, BOOKS &amp; BONE is still going to be published, something that seemed entirely beyond my reach when this month began.  Thank you so much for that!  Over the next few days, until 1:55pm GMT on 1 March, I'd like to provide daily updates and maybe a little bit of fun. This has been an incredible experience and I'm eager to share it with you.  As part of that, I recorded a series of toots I wrote for the Fediverse in the style of a self-help guide to friendship. It's a little rough, but it made me smile to write and record it. I hope you'll enjoy it, too.  (link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kYI-6ZcJzE&amp;feature=youtu.be )                            4 days left.  With love and awkwardness,  Victoria\",\n 'Concrete Plans  It still seems magical to me that so many people have believed in BOOKS &amp; BONE and funded it, but I\\'m trying not to let wonder get in the way of practicality. I\\'ve prepped the manuscript and it goes to the proofreader tomorrow, and I\\'m making plans for the cover concept ready to commission Anna Pazyniuk.  Real progress is happening with this novel, and it\\'s because of you. Thank you. I\\'ll be sure to keep you updated at every step of the way and share what images and process I can!  Slowing down ... but maybe we can still make it!  All projects have a maximum \"reach\" or whatever they call it -- there\\'s only so far info about it can travel, and I suspect that BOOKS &amp; BONE may be reaching it. New backers have slowed to a fine trickle for the first time since the campaign started.  I\\'m not disappointed, because it funded so quickly and through the generosity of so many people. I\\'m not giving up, either, because this campaign is  only halfway through.Ã‚\\xa0   There\\'s still time to reach the first stretch goal and get BOOKS &amp; BONE more widely available and out from under Amazon\\'s thumb. I\\'m going to keep going and keep trying. And though I can hardly ask more of you than I already have, if there\\'s anywhere you would like to share this or anyone you think might be interested, please do talk about it. Word of mouth is the only thing that will grow this campaign.  Fun things on the horizon  I\\'m going to run another Necromancer Field Trip on Sunday 17 February at 5pm GMT (9am PST/12pm ET) on  https://www.twitch.tv/vicorva  and the game will be a mystery! Well ... it\\'ll either be Skyrim, Oblivion, or Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. Whatever I can get to run! We\\'ll study necromancers up close and personal ... and hopefully with a minimum of bloodshed. I\\'d love to talk to anyone who feels like turning up.  This is really happening!  Even this tentative progress seems so unreal. The publishing process has begun.  Thank you.  With love and awkwardness,  Victoria',\n \"Overwhelmed!  As of Day 6 of the campaign, we are 82% funded! I feel utterly overwhelmed by the generosity of backers and everyone who has been sharing and spreading the word about BOOKS &amp; BONE. It is really looking very likely that BOOKS &amp; BONE will fund and I am practically vibrating with excitement.  That said, I'm still very nervous that we won't make it! So if you know anyone who loves fantasy books or mildly spooky things, please do let them know.   Field Trip Successful  Our field trip went very well indeed. I was so happy to see people on the stream and get to chat to people as we played through the Hitting the Books quest in Skyrim. It was fun to comment on the necromancers and their habits from the perspective of them being people and not just villains to be dispatched. We had a good go at befriending them but they were NOT making it easy!  Unfortunately, I lost the second half of the stream -- I think I might have accidentally double-clicked record. Which is a huge shame because it was very fun and very much a memory I wanted to keep. I guess it's a moment that will just be between me and those who were there. But I've got the first half uploaded to youtube for anyone who feels they missed out.  This was my first ever livestream so please excuse how frantic I am!  Special thanks go to my sister for lending me her gaming laptop for the day when it became clear that my desktop was not gonna cut it!  (The video doesn't always load in this message, so here's the link as well:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3wq1bZAF5I  )                            Onwards to Victory?  With only a little over Ã‚Â£120 to go until BOOKS &amp; BONE is fully funded, I'm very excited to see what happens over the next few days.  Thank you all so very much for your support. If you have any questions or anything you'd like to talk about, feel free to message me through kickstarter or leave a comment on the campaign and I'd be happy to respond.  We're so, so close.   With love and awkwardness,  Victoria\",\n \"Hi all,  I'm excited to say that I'm all prepped and ready to take you all on a Necromancer Field Trip today in Ã‚\\xa0Skyrim on Sunday 3 February  at 6pm GMT (1pm ET/10am PST) at   twitch.tv/vicorva.   My desktop absolutely COULD NOT run it after all, but my sister has kindly lent me her gaming laptop for the day so that we can all enjoy a nice stream while we chat.  I'm definitely the kind of person who needs an activity to focus on while I socialise with people, and hopefully this will be it!  Feel free to join me to chat necromancy, BOOKS &amp; BONE, writing, kickstarter, and really anything else. And of course I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have!  Maybe I'll see you later.  With love and awkwardness,  Victoria\",\n \"Recap!  It's Day 3 of the campaign and BOOKS &amp; BONE is already 56% funded. I am daring to hope, and that is a wonderful and frightening thing. I owe so much to you generous folk who have backed this and shared it. This morning, when I saw the numbers, I was completely overwhelmed and very tearful.  There's still a long way to go. But BOOKS &amp; BONE is more than halfway to being real. Thank you.  Livestream Necromancer Field Trip!  So! I wanted to take some time to get to know my backers and maybe answer any questions you might have! We can talk about this book (without spoilers) or books generally, I'm happy to share what I've learned about kickstarter so far, and I'd be delighted to talk writing or fantasy or necromancers or cats (because I'm always happy to talk about cats).Ã‚\\xa0  My shaky plan is to stream  Skyrim on Sunday 3 February at 6pm GMT (1pm ET/10am PST) at   twitch.tv/vicorva . I have never streamed before but I'll be testing on Saturday. And although I have played A GREAT DEAL OF SKYRIM I've never played it on PC before (having not realised my terrible PC can run it) so that'll be interesting.  We'll visit lots of necromancer lairs and just have a nice relaxed conversation in-between fleeing in terror. Really, I just want you to have something to look at while we talk! And it might be a nice way to pass the time for an hour or so for those snowed-in.  I'll post another update when the stream goes live.Ã‚\\xa0  Let's keep this going  If that sounds good, I'll see you then! But in the meantime, please do continue to share and signal boost this campaign if you wouldn't mind. Every donation is a huge help and gets this book just a little closer to being real.  With love and awkwardness,  Victoria\",\n \"Hi All!  With it being just a little over a month since we funded, I figured you'd like to know where the project stands.Ã‚\\xa0   As of today, we are 100% on schedule.  Stories are in (less a couple stragglers), edits are finished and heading out to the authors this week). Cover design is on track, and delivery infrastructure is established. We are solid so far.Ã‚\\xa0   Backer Surveys Went Out Last Week , which means you should message me if you haven't received yours.

I've been busy working on Hypnos and getting it ready for publication.  Things will be quiet here until I have something substantial to show you: the initial print (paperback and hardback) version of the book. That'll happen within two weeks of finishing the editing of the project, as it takes approximately that long to process the book with the printer. If everything checks out, the books for the kickstarter will be ordered. After that, it's just a matter of waiting for Burn, Baby, Burn to release and it to go through the same process.  Thanks for your patience, folks, and I look forward to showing you the proofs of the print editions!  ~RJ\",\n \"Hey, folks!  Shipping options are being added for the UK, Australia, and Canada. Some tiers already have these options added, and they're being added as we have time!  If you live in one of these countries and you want a tier that doesn't have it, drop a message or a comment with your country and the tier, and we'll make sure you are covered.  We know the shipping is expensive. (And in good news, if shipping is over charged, you get swag in the box to cover the difference, although it may delay some shipments by 2-3 weeks so the ordered swag can arrive in the mail!)  (We want to make sure you get your money's worth.)  Thanks for your support, everyone!  Oh, and as a side note, we forgot Shammed (a Bernadette Franklin book) is releasing before this kickstarter ends. It will have a paperback version. So, any order set tier receiving a copy of  Claustrophobic  will also get a copy of Shammed. (IE: the complete collection of RJ Blain paperbacks.) (The price of this tier will not change. The human will omnomnomnomnom the costs for it since it was her mistake.)  Bernadette Franklin is RJ's contemporary romantic comedy pen name.

Quick update from me.Kickstarter are still processing the funds for White Pines, but this does not mean that I haven't been hard at work in the background sourcing a book cover designer (and I found someone horror afficionados will be familiar with, who will no doubt create something really memorable...

Kickstarter will also notify you on launch if you hit the button on the preview page there, so you can be the first to jump on it when it's ready!

Here's one of them:       ...yet another illustration! And with Leigh University in the back, or at least my attempt at it! I was overachieving, definitely. :D  We are coasting toward a beautiful finish on Monday--I suspect we're going to stay where we are to close, and that's perfect. The narrator's already delivered me the first fifteen minutes of Book 2, which is due at the end of March, so I anticipate more glory soon! Ã‚\\xa0Actually, I think he might blow through Books 2 and 3 so quickly that I probably won't run a separate Kickstarter for Book 2 at all! I'll wrap both Books 2 and 3 together and run it in April to recoup the costs from his lightning-fast work. That'll give me time to decide whether I want to do a single-shot Almond or Kelu plush toy for the highest level backer. Wouldn't that be either adorable or bitey? *beams*  Is there anything more wonderful than a Friday?

I came across this one, and it's... well, Book 1 isn't it. :D  Very certainly it's supposed to be of the three of them at Kemses's home in Erevar, in the middle of the book. He's still human, since he's got the rounded ears, but he's got the Archipelago clothing.       In retrospect I feel like I have to ask why I gave the genets navels. They weren't born like natural creatures! *puzzled* I should have thought that through. :D  I'm having a lot of fun going through these old pieces. Really the biggest question is 'how big do I want this art book to be', because it could get pretty large! I'm aiming for 20 pieces, so far. Maybe I'll go higher if I find enough stuff I like and that I can scan. (Many of the originals have been sold, so I have to trust that the scans are good enough.)  We are closing in on the end of week 1! I am so excited! I can't wait to share the audio with you (or the book in its other forms if that's what you're picking up.)

What I really love about this one, other than the affection, is the design elements. If I remember right, I sketched this piece after a trip to the  Frank Lloyd Wright House and Studio in Chicago . I've always loved Art Deco as a style, so I came out of that tour with stars in my eyes and (apparently) inspiration in my hands.  When I first finished the sketch, it was my goal to transfer it and paint it... and I never did because the idea of coloring it intimidated me...! I think I did four or five color tests for it and could never decide how I wanted to handle it. Come to think of it, I'm not sure how I'd handle it now! But I'm glad I put it on paper, because I'm still fond of it.  Definitely one for the art book. *nods*  *checks progress on actual project*   We are $418 away from our third stretch goal , the Almond bookmarks! This is marvelous and crazy because I didn't think we'd make even the first stretch goal, much less the first two. O_O I wonder if we'll make it before the project ends?? Wouldn't that be something! *bounces* In the meantime... happy Wednesday, everyone! And thanks again for backing. You're the best. &lt;3\",\n 'Hey Everyone!

Kickstarter has finally forwarded your pledges, which means we can cross the start line and get running.Ã‚\\xa0  The book has been sent to the editor to give it a final look over. I've been told this can take a few weeks but hopefully sooner. Once this is done, the text will be placed in the waiting artwork files and then sent to print.  Production on the letters and map will begin soon. With the map, I'm looking to see if we can upgrade the paper to more of a parchment, this way we won't be printing the texture and give a more authentic feel, but we'll have to see what the tests come out like, it may look too bland for what I had in mind.  If you haven't already, head over to the link below to vote on the bookmark design you like the most. The winning design will go into production and come free with any book pledge.

An update to say congratulations, you've unlocked another stretch goal! All backers will now be able to download the A4 version of the map to see all the key locations across 1853 London. This is great digital item but it lives in the shadow of the printed A2 version available on the add-ons list, why not check it out, its going to be very cool ;)  This means we have a new stretch goal to aim for. Once unlocked, all backers will have access to an online timeline that shows, in order, when the events of the stories happened, along with a few notes to keep track of other events from the Sisterhood. This is a guarded item for me and its the way I keep everything clear on the page. So its a great insight and an easy way to cross-reference events.

These will be collected on the surveys that will be sent out after the project has finished funding.  Fingers crossed the next stretch goal will be unlocked soon, keep sharing the project on social media!  I had better get thinking of more stretch goals haha  Thanks for all your support  Kirk\",\n '.  Hey Everyone,  The map add-on is now live on the project page, woohoo!  The streets of Victorian London are almost its own character within the Sisterhood stories. While writing I research and tie the events to real locations to help give the story a deeper sense of realism. I always loved the idea that as a reader you would be able to look up these places and discover more about the Sisterhood.Ã‚\\xa0  For the first time these locations have been pinpointed for you on an A2 map. The original map is from 1853 and the large print size allows a lot of detail to be displayed. The maps will be printed on 135gsm A2 paper, printed texture on both sides which enables it to be folded and presented like an old map. These will be posted directly from me in the UK.  The image strip underneath is hopefully 1:1 scale (I guess depending on your screen), but the numbered circles are around 7mm wide, so there is lots of detail to look over and enjoy, with the added bonus of the Sisterhood knowledge.  If you would like to have the map as part of your reward,  please add an additional Ã‚Â£11 to your current pledge per map   - no limits per backer!   Keep spreading the word and hopefully we can get some more stretch goals unlocked :)  Kirk',\n \"Hey Everyone!

We've unlocked the first stretch goal  for the bookmark, the designs for which will be available soon to vote on.  The printed map is very close to being finalised so hold tight, this add-on is awesome even if I do say so myself :) Fingers crossed I'll have this online in the next day or two, watch this space!

I'll create some designs and let you guys vote on which one will go into production. I'll get this sorted as soon as possible so we've go plenty of time to get some ideas flowing. PM me if there is anything you think would be cool.  Eric Lee, your fellow backer, had the idea of adding a map of London that has locations from the stories pin pointed on. I love this idea and I'm going to look into sorting out an add-on that has a large map to unfold or maybe some smaller ones that I can include for free, but I will look into it for you.

Thank you again.Ã‚\\xa0\",\n \"Ã‚\\xa0During my time in Hollywood, I was trying to reinvent myself by adapting and assimilating to fit in. I wanted to be more than someone people thought was pretty. I wanted to act. But, I was limited to what roles I could go for because of how I looked. My look created a prison for me, and was laced with ugliness and alienation. My internal self was constantly in defense mode, and working like hell to heal itself before the next encounter. But the encounters came too fast and furious to be able to defend the ramification that came with it. The more I worked my way through Hollywood, the more I was confronted and abused. I thought that if I could prove myself as a real actor, then I would be respected and taken seriously. But that was never to be. Frustrated and a bit bored about playing the rich and privileged jock, I started exploring the deeper angst parts and I tried to prove that I was something more--or I thought I was something more. Hollywood created a person who could change to meet the requirements expected, but deep down I was filled with anger and rage--unable to grasp the meaning of being an object for others' pleasure and the desire to find true love. Who am I?Ã‚\\xa0      A photo shoot that started to explore the deeper side of me.\",\n '1974 iconic novel cover and Patricia Nell Warren    It is with a sad heart that I share a friend, Patricia Nell Warren, who wrote the 1974 ground breaking novel, The Front Runner, passed away yesterday. I was screen-tested for the lead role of Billy Sive when Paul Newman was scheduled to play Harlan Brown. Unfortunately, the film was not made. I was brought back a second time when Jerry Wheeler was producing it with Frank Perry and Greg Louganis in the cast, but it was not made either. Since these two failures, Patricia and remained friends and she encouraged me to be brave enough to share my story and write. I truly hope that I can complete Out-Cast: The Hollywood Years, and share my amazing friendship with this icon.     20th Anniversary Edition Cover',\n 'One of my early headshots    Moving to Hollywood was a huge undertaking. I knew I wanted to be where the movies were made, because I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think I was talented enough to make it in New York on Broadway. I was constantly told that I needed to be on the big screen and where the pretty people wereÃ¢\\x80\\x94which I never really understood, because I never considered myself pretty. I step off the plane into LA humidity with three hundred dollars in my pocket, looking for a man I had never met. A man that one of the benefactors had help several years ago. Was I being passed off again?Ã‚\\xa0  One thing I did have was the small role on  General Hospital  to look forward to. I had done some extra parts and day roles while I was attending U.C.I., and this was going to be my big break, I thought. So, forward I went, keeping my eyes on my future.  But no matter where I ended up, I always seemed to be looking for that one person, that soul mate, that perfect friend that I could grab hands with and face all the challenges. I found that person in April Audia, an incredible young actress with a Long Island hutzpah and the most intoxicating blue eyes. As soon as our eyes met at an audition, we were the last two in the waiting room, I knew this person was special and I needed to get to know her. I was clumsy and awkward. I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t look at her, because her eyes were so amazing. Even with my inability to communicate like a human, somehow, we became best friends and agreed to attack Tinsel Town as a team.Ã‚\\xa0  I wondered, \"Could I fall in love with April?\"  Follow our story in Out-Cast: The Hollywood Years. Ã‚\\xa0Ã‚\\xa0     April Audia\\'s headshot',\n 'Ã‚\\xa0Dedicated to the person who is always there:Ã‚\\xa0       The memories are shattered, like a stained-glass window. Shards of details remain, but some are destroyed/disintegrated beyond recognitionÃ¢\\x80\\x94yet the minutest physical slivers remain; pointy, sharp, jagged, and burrowed deep withinÃ¢\\x80\\x94unable to be reached and removed my tweezers. Like splinters from a piece of wood, they remain under the surface of the skin, waiting to be agitated or rubbed to remind me they are still there.Ã‚\\xa0  To survive, maybe I forced the shattering of these memories, so that I may function to the best of my ability each day. Sometimes, only the shards of details are remaining: a smell, a color, an image. Concrete data such as time, place, dates may have snapped away, but the splinters are still residing under the skin. I may not recall all the concrete data, but it does not negate that the experience took place. Our Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood Old BoyÃ¢\\x80\\x9d society does not want to acknowledge this, and demands for the time, location, and date of such demoralizing and shattering events to deem it true. If one of these are missing, it is so easy to ignore it and deny its existenceÃ¢\\x80\\x94That is why so many predators are set free with a slap to the hand, while the victim continues to fight each day.Ã‚\\xa0  Does a predator completely understand the vital life they had taken from someone in the fleeting moment of selfish pleasure? I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know. All I know is that I lose a piece of me every time I remember the event, smell a certain odor, see a certain color, taste a certain flavor, feel a certain textile. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a constant battle to organize the puzzle pieces every morning, with pieces missing, to face and function throughout the day. What about the people who are trying to help the shattered psyche, does the predator understand how this effects their lives? Maybe the predator just doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care.Ã‚\\xa0  Bless the person who is trying to help me put the pieces back together. The difficulty it must be to love and support a person who has been shattered, when he canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t comprehend the internal turmoil. Thank you for hanging in there with me.Ã‚\\xa0',\n 'I was sixteen and I was sneaking away every Wednesday evening to take acting and modeling classes with the infamous Norma Sharkey. My parents thought I was at diving practiceÃ¢\\x80\\x94they would have freaked out if they knew I was driving myself to downtown Dayton. But, I discovered that I had another dream Ã‚\\xa0other than winning a gold medal at the Olympics.Ã‚\\xa0      My dream of dancing on stage became a reality    I nodded and rushed out the door, down the marbled staircase and out onto the Dayton sidewalk, bypassing homeless people, dodging business men rushing home, and pausing in front of the Victoria Theatre. A huge poster announcing the upcoming ballet performance of  Romeo and Juliet  with two dancers emotionally embracing sent me on an emotional roller-coaster.  The female dancer was stunning with her long curling hair framing her innocent face and cascading down her shoulders and back. But it was the male dancer that was beautiful, his short and tight curly blond hair accentuated his angular cheek bones and added a golden glow to his skin. His sleek and yet masculine physic was compelling with the agility and strength of a young colt. For some strange reason, I knew deep within in me that I was someday going to dance on stage, somewhere. The trill of this discovery, plus the adrenaline rush from performing in the showcase, lifted me off the ground and carried me a fantastical vision of my unlimited future.Ã‚\\xa0',\n 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s72Z57Lj5P0   Excerpt from Out-Cast: The Hollywood Years:Ã‚\\xa0  I remember running into the building looking for April, excited to share my news. Ã‚\\xa0She stood on the staircase, talking to another actress. I took a moment and relished the way the shaft of light coming through the window bathed her, casting her dark hair with an aura of gold. Her smile flashed as she looked lovingly, cocked her head and intensely gazed at the person speaking. I recognized that gaze as I have been on the receiving end, feeling like I was the only person in the world she was interested in. I felt a deep affection for this beautiful young woman, wanting to kiss her full lips, and shout out the news that I just booked my first national commercial for Long John Silvers. Ã‚\\xa0But I waited, patiently for my turn.Ã‚\\xa0     Commercial Picture for Exclusive Artist Agency, 1985',\n \"My next theatrical break came in 1985 when I found myself cast in John RechyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  Tigers Wild , a special limited engagement prior to the New York opening at the Zephyr Theatre. The play was based on RechyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s novel  The Fourth Angel.  During the first reading, I was sitting around the table with Sarah Jessica Parker, John Allee, and Leonard Porter Salazar as the foursome that in the play traveled the West Texas landscape for two days trying to understand the meaning of life and getting into trouble. I had to kiss Sarah every performance. The play did move to New York, but Sarah and I were not part of the production which got mixed reviews. Later Sarah said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey really need us in it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d     Publicity shot     During this time, Sarah was dating Robert Downey Jr. and I was dating April. The four us hung out together. While Sarah and I were on stage, Robert and April were spending time together. In  Out-Cast: The Hollywood Years,  we became the foursome that faced Hollywood.     Sarah Jessica Parker    This provided me more opportunities and one was the top contender for the feature film,  Diving In.  The project's Executive Producers, Ted Shuel and Mark Shaw wanted Sarah and I in the film. Once again, neither Sarah or I were cast.     Indianapolis Star Article\",\n 'I have had the please to be interviewed by blogger Natalie Wolf last evening and here is her story:  https://writteninpiecestheblog.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-liberation-of-john-michael-lander.html?spref=fb&amp;fbclid=IwAR2_te8JpjN7bTamg0ytgbqCRC0b71ZvWQkWMZDYQ0_iV9MinzS43xU7a5EÃ‚\\xa0   Thank you Natalie.Ã‚\\xa0',\n 'The poster and playbill    My first role I originated found me on stage at the Cast Theatre in Los Angeles in the October CompanyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s World Premiere of Louis La Russo IIÃ¢\\x80\\x99s  Vespers Eve  directed by Richard Le Pore. I was surrounded by such heavy weight actors as John Aprea, John Fiorito, John Del Regno, Ray Abruzzo, Robert Gallo, Debra Feuer, and Wendy MacDonald. I felt like I was surrounded by the Italian mafia.  What am I doing here? I am such a greenhorn next to these talented and accomplished actors.  And to top it all off, my character, Derek, opened the show with John Aprea playing Joey Adonis. I played this naÃƒÂ¯ve waiter that is setting up the Bridal Suite of Atlantic CityÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Presidential Hotel in 1929. Derek was a clumsy, awkward, and always entering and exiting at the wrong time. I found myself exploring physical comedy.Ã‚\\xa0     Promotional picture: Playing Derek in Vespers Eve    I received my first reviews. The LA Daily News stated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJohn-Michael Lander as the gangstersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 waiter is a well-timed comic relief. Another review said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJohn-Michael Lander is enthusiastic as the waiter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d while another shared, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe thugs talk rough to the green-horned waiter who cheerily pops in now and then.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I had one that said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe ladies from the bordello are decorative and utilitarian, they, like John-Michael Lander as the naÃƒÂ¯ve young waiter, are disadvantageously stereotyped by the author, the director, or both.Ã¢\\x80\\x9dÃ‚\\xa0  I felt that I had made a small mark in Tinsel Town. Doors started opening for, and agents began calling.Ã‚\\xa0     Cast list',\n 'I am always asked why I wanted to write  Surface Tension  and now,  Out-Cast: The Hollywood Years  as fiction instead of non-fiction? My initial reply is that I wanted the freedom to expand on and alter things in order to enhance the flow if the story. But the real reason is that I needed the freedom to take a step away and allow the characters to tell the story. I was not able to verbalize the needed message coming directly through me. There is a safety, within my mind, that by writing fiction, I become an objective observer and simply report the events. Otherwise, I would never have shared my story. As much as I want people to become aware of the long-term effects of sexual abuse, face the past, and find their true self; my fragile and shamed self was not able to get the truth out. I still struggle with the implications of what the word Ã¢\\x80\\x98victimÃ¢\\x80\\x99 means. Merriam-WebberÃ¢\\x80\\x99s definition of victim is, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c1: a person who is cheated, fooled, or hurt by another.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d My ego would not accept this in my conscious mind. I would not allow myself to accept that I was fooled, groomed, or manipulated by someone else. To me, this meant that I was weak, naive, and gullible. The guilt and shame that I attached to the responsibility I felt regarding the events was/is so overpowering that I did not initially know how to voice my deep seeded pain. I hid it behind a smile and a joke. I adapted and assimilated into what I thought the surrounding environment and society wanted. I wore masks and pretended to be someone else in order to fit in. I lost my true self and am just beginning to find him through writing. David allowed me to go to the places that needed to be shared and are still needing to be shared so that I can paint a picture of how survivors struggles through their lives. Each personÃ¢\\x80\\x99s story is unique and there is not a single remedy that fits everyone.

So what happens now?

And one of the favorite places was a library at the end of our street, the old Superior Branch of the Cleveland Public Library. It was on E 105th at the time, a small red brick building that always seemed too small for the two distinct sections, three offices, a reading room and the meeting rooms it held.   My grandmother would take me every Saturday and while the kids were in circle time, I would try to sneak into the grownup section to read the next book by the authors I would pilfer from my uncle (Lawrance Sanders, Stephen King, Adam Hall), while Grande filled her allotment with the latest westerns and romances.Ã‚\\xa0  The librarian always caught me and would send me to the childrenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s section with itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s lighter fare that held no interest to me.Ã‚\\xa0  This happened nearly weekly and after the third time, the librarian made sure I was in the front of the reading group so her assistant could see me and pulled my Grande aside to have a long talk with her. When circle time was over and we could check out our books, the librarian called me over. She had Encyclopedia Brown, True Grit and The Illustrated Man waiting for me.Ã‚\\xa0  That went on to C.S. Lewis, Judy Blume, and Agatha Christie on my (specially made) summer reading and the first week of fourth grade, I picked up Different Seasons by Stephen King.Ã‚\\xa0  In that book, I read the story that made me a fan (and a writer) for life.   Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.Ã‚\\xa0  There was something about a horror writer writing a story about hope that could resonate so deeply within me. Somehow, I was able to see myself in Andy and I vowed that the reader would be able to see themselves in my stories.Ã‚\\xa0  I have been able to do that so far and with your help, I'll be able to continue!Ã‚\\xa0  Thanks for your support and please share as we are in the last days of the campaign!Ã‚\\xa0\",\n 'I think IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m ready!Ã‚\\xa0    I have been ready cozies since I can remember, studying the new stuff, and practicing my craft in over a dozen books and I think that now I am ready to do it.Ã‚\\xa0    I am ready to start a cozy mystery series of my own. I am so excited.Ã‚\\xa0    Once I decided that I was ready to create a cozy section of the universe, I needed to decide what universe to create it in.      I was going to do one in my high fantasy universe, Allazar, but the worldbuilding is so complex that I would spend more time on the culture than the universe, so I put it on the shelf.    Then I started working on Shaman States of America and found the perfect place for a cozy.Ã‚\\xa0    But before that, I little about myself.Ã‚\\xa0    I love chemistry. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s one of those rare sciences that you use every day. Cooking is highly familiar chemical reactions. Your air conditioner, fridge, car, everything has a chemical component to it.     And I spend a lot of time, cooking, baking, painting and also glass blowing metalsmithing -Ã‚\\xa0    And soapmaking,Ã‚\\xa0    I started that after my daughter was allergic and too poor to buy fancy detergent-free soap out of using beef tallow, lard, and cocoa butter. Ã‚\\xa0It was fun, useful and I was addicted.Ã‚\\xa0    I made soap for years and then I let it go in favor of other pursuits, but not completely. I started blending scents for the characters in my Allazar and Shaman States books and thought it would nice if there was a shop where they bought their post-Hunt scrub-up from.Ã‚\\xa0    So I started looking into soapmaking again watching YouTube videos.Ã‚\\xa0    Royal Soaps (Katie Carson) and Royal Apple Berry (Kenny Lef - Kenny the Messy Soaper) are my favorites. TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re both quirky, extremely upbeat, fun and their soaps are wonderful. I could see a combo of the two making the soap and talking to powered and non-powered folks in Austin.Ã‚\\xa0    Then it occurred to meÃ¢\\x80Â¦ what if they solved murders? And what if I provided recipes in the back of the book?      WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re about to find out with Beauty Bubble.Ã‚\\xa0',\n \"-- Ã‚\\xa0Hello all, Chrishaun here!Ã‚\\xa0  The Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPush the Button, Chrishaun!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d party was a blast, and we have raised $720 on the first two days!Ã‚\\xa0  ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s 25% of the total goal and fantastic support! I needed to take a long time just looking at it to make sure that it was real.  Thank you! I take your faith in me extremely seriously, and I'm dedicated to creating a great story that you will love!  We had a bit of a reward mixup that slipped by me on the final look through, and I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t realize it until the project was live.Ã‚\\xa0  But after some thought, it turned out great because it allowed me to offer those that didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get to be the victim in Handmade Murder (Those rewards are all gone! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m still amazed and thrilled!)a $75 reward that features you in one of three short stories that I will be writing in the same location!Ã‚\\xa0  You can solve a mystery with Poppy, have a problem that you want solved, or even own one of the food trucks in the Jocelyn Plaza where the actual shop is (Anyone thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s seen my Instagram knows that food trucks are a HUGE thing in Austin and my life, so you know I had to have a few).Ã‚\\xa0  LetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s keep the momentum up!

They are shipping via media-mail and the post office tells me that domestic media mail should arrive within 3-8 days depending on how far you are from Tennessee. For international backers, I will be sending you all some messages with more details regarding your books as they ship out! My goal is to have them all en-route by this weekend.  A note: as with any first try at anything, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been made aware of a couple small typos in the manuscript that somehow slipped past three betas, two alphas, and two copy editors, which is irritating to me as all getout! Stubborn little wells they be! but I wanted to let you all know I have been made aware of it by a few of the backers who have gotten their copies and I thank you for laughing with me as I Amend the manuscript. Perhaps it will never be a double headed penny worth millions of dollars, but at least you can chuckle and shake your head a couple times.  Hardcovers- I have been in touch with the printer and the lovely lass, Taylor, told me I should receive a shipping notification either today or tomorrow! From that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have an exact arrival date, but she said 3-5 days in transit.

All remarkably on schedule for the books to be available at the beginning of April, when I\\'ll send them out to all of you who\\'ve pr-ordered OR hand them personally to anybody who opted to pick them up at one of the Wrexham launch events. More details of those soon but, meanwhile, I just thought I\\'d see whether, when I sign your copy, you\\'d like me to write something in particular and/or mention anybody else in the dedication. Well, just let me know. Otherwise it will be something like... \"To (your name), with best wishes and many thanks from Dave.\"  By the way, I\\'ve started picking up some interesting Yale memorabilia. Apart from the copy of Elihu\\'s will from the National Archives (with that notorious line,  \"To my wicked wife...\" ), and some other original correspondence from Yale University, I also came across this little beauty. It\\'s an Elihu Yale Toby Jug, produced by Wedgewood in 1933 to commemorate the founding of Yale University Printing Services. Nice!',\n 'Well, we picked up some new subscribers who pre-ordered the book after we hit the 100% funding target so great to have you all on board. And what\\'s happening right now?  OK, so the text had been edited and edited and edited before it even went to the publisher, and then they have to get the content ready to go to the printers. They finished that work a few weeks ago and then we had to go through the proofs looking for anything that might be wrong - the odd typo here, or a missing quotation mark there. Corrections. And then the whole thing pored over yet again with the final proofs. All sorted now and the only thing that remains is to add in the list of all you lovely folk who\\'ve pre-ordered. That\\'s almost finished and then it all goes off to the printers - the start of several anxious weeks while we wait to see what this new-born will actually look like when it hits the streets. I hate this bit!  Meanwhile, we start the process of marketing the novel to bookstores. If any of you know local bookstores that might be interested in this one, let me know and the team here (that\\'s Ann, by the way) will get in touch with them.  Second, it\\'s always good to have reviews lined up for posting on Amazon and elsewhere as close to publication date as possible. A couple of you have already offered to do this but if anybody\\'s interested, I can let you have a PDF version of the book in advance of you receiving the actual paperback copy. It\\'s only a PDF version though and some e-readers aren\\'t very good at displaying PDFs but if you want to give it a go, just let me know.

Thank you to everyone who backed and/or shared this project. During the next week here, I'll start confirming the information I will need to send out backer copies.  There's not going to be much to say for now, but sometime in February I will be showing the cover with title designs, as well as a table of contents reveal. (Not necessarily in that order; it will depend on when the finished cover design comes together.) In mid-March, I will have more information about the exact release date. The fulfillment date I listed on the project is based on a comfortably padded safety margin. If I can get the books out faster, I will.  Thank you once again!\",\n \"My cover artist, the very talented Amanda Sharpe, has sent me a digital image of the finished painting. She really nailed what I was going for in that she incorporated all of the elements that I wanted, but the composition she came up with is so much better than any way I could see it in my head before she showed me her mock-up.     THE BEES!    Since the title I picked for the collection is kind of prosaic and very mundane, I wanted a cover that would emphasize the speculative, juxtaposing some of the fantastic elements from some of the stories in a way that was very vivid and dream-like. And she delivered.  Now, this is not the final cover, obviously. I wanted a cover painting that would work as a painting on its own, so I asked her to leave specific spaces open where logo design can be composited in later. I think the distribution of the elements looks really good. You can probably imagine how it might look as a book cover, but it doesn't feel like it's missing anything without a title and byline.  I am pleased as punch.\",\n \"Well, those of you who follow me on or about the social mediums might know that we just went through a time here with our furnace being dead for two very cold weeks in November.  This impacted a number of my plans (it dang near derailed my NaNoWriMo participation for 2018, I can tell you that) but FIRST DATES, LAST CALLS has impact-absorbing crumple zones in its schedule. So, for those who have asked: no, it will not affect my project timeline at all.  While I will probably never stop looking for ways to improve the presentation and order of stories until it has to go to print, the bulk of the work on the collection itself is already finished. The estimated delivery date of summer 2019 is meant to account for factors beyond my control (like this one), if they should happen pile up one on top of each other.Ã‚\\xa0  The one thing it did set back was my attempts to publicize the campaign and spread it far and wide. Even without my attention and energy on it, though, we are now 162% funded. Whoo! I'd like to see how much higher we can go. I'll be making some more updates to this project in the coming weeks, and in the meantime, if you have a social media platform that you can share this one, it would be a big help.\",\n \"Hello, backers and everyone who is following this project! I just want to say thank you for a whirlwind of a first day. As I'm typing this, 24 hours in, we're like 57% of the way to our goal, which gives me a pretty good feeling about my prospects for getting fully funded?  If you follow me closely enough on Twitter, you might know that I did a couple of not-terribly-scientific market research attempts to get some idea if the demand was there, and how strong it was. For my first Kickstarter I've kept things simple and based the tiers and the goal on the bare minimum to make this happen, and the early indications are that I've hit the mark there. Even if things taper off a bit from the early rush, I've left myself with a full two months to land this baby.  So let's talk about what you can do to help. Obviously pledging is the most direct thing, but the pledges won't matter if we don't bring this over the top. Let's not underestimate the effect of sharing on social media. If you backed the project, please feel entirely free to shout it out loud -- on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, anywhere that you hang out. If you see me tweeting or sharing a link, feel free to boost that, if that's more comfortable for you.  Whatever you're willing to do, whether it's pledging a buck or telling a friend, you'll help make this book a reality, and for that, I thank you!\",\n 'Hello again,  There are 5 days left and this project is almost fully backed!

Also, got the initial draft from our map designer and she is doing a great job - should have something to share on that with everyone soon.

Hope everyone had a great Christmas and, with any luck, I'll have another update to share before New Year's Eve!\",\n \"Merry Christmas everyone!! In the home stretch with the goal of finishing the book over the Christmas break. Just finished Chapter 10 which was another fun chapter for me. As I've joked with Dallas before, as a writer, you sometimes don't know where a chapter will take you. You have a beginning and a possible ending in mind but usually the middle takes on a life of its own and then the ending is wherever that middle takes you. This chapter has a surprise ending that made me realize where the next chapter of the book will begin and end with a surprising outcome resulting from this chapter. Does that make sense? It will when you read Chapter 10 and 11 back to back!Ã‚\\xa0  So, in closing, hope you all have a wonderful time next week with family and friends! Should have another update before New Year's!\",\n \"Wow! Haven't kept as close an eye on the project this 2nd time around but received an email this morning that we hit our goal!

Actually, wrapping up Chapter 10 today so I'm still on track to finish the first draft of the book for editing by end of December. Saw some early sketches from Mostafa on the book cover this week and selected one. He is busy working on a first draft which I'll post on our Facebook page and here once its done.

As David has mentioned in his blog articles, we plan to release all of the Thorndkye works over the coming months and Kickstarter plays a critical part in that - thanks!  a)  The Detective and The Woman  - by Amy Thomas - book one of three with book four on its way in 2019 -Ã‚\\xa025 Amazon reviews - average 4.2 out of 5 stars.  b)  The Final Page of Baker Street  - by Daniel D Victor - book one of four - 16 Amazon reviews - average 4.2 out of 5 stars.Ã‚\\xa0  c)  The Open and Shut Case  - by Harry Demaio - book one of nine - 31 Amazon reviews - average 4.8 out of 5 stars.Ã‚\\xa0\",\n \"Another excellent day taking us to 38 backers in the first Thorndyke project. As promised, we have added another reward - five sets of hardcovers signed by the editor David Marcum. Due to the big issues we've had with international shipping signed copies, these are only available in the USA so David can ship them safely using tracked ground shipping.  As we go through this week we will add a stretch goal (hint, if we hit it we will add a free extra book for all backers) so well worth sharing the project. We know there are lots of Thorndyke fans out there - a key reason why David took on the challenge of bringing the stories back to circulation.  We are also trying to create awareness through LinkedIn  'Resurrecting A Great Detective'  and have written a short article. It would be great if you could like and share it (if you are a LinkedIn patron)Ã‚\\xa0\",\n 'A big thanks to all our backers. A fantastic start to our campaign, with the initial goal passed on day 1. We will add another reward today.',\n \"Thank you to everyone who has helped me reach my goal! I can't wait to share this story with you!Ã‚\\xa0\",\n \"The new t-shirts arrived today and look pretty fly (even if we do say so ourselves). We've also dispatched them all now, wrapping up the delivery of all the physical goods. Give it some time for postage, but if you don't receive your package soon, please let us know.  That just leaves Outside Edges, which is still a work in progress; we'll keep you posted. In the meantime, and if you haven't already, you can sign up to the mailing list to receive an exclusive short story set just outside cyberpunkdreams' Cincinnati.

Please give it at least a couple of weeks though for international orders.  The t-shirts are in progress. We're hoping to send those (and associated goodies) within a couple of weeks. We're working with the same printers who did the t-shirts first time around, so we're expecting the same great quality (they're so soft!)  Outside Edges is also still in progress. A bunch of the writing has been done, and we have the cover art (which looks amazing, even if I do say so myself). It's going to take a little while longer to get it all properly polished, but we'll keep you posted.  Thanks again for your support!  Rob\",\n \"Just a quick heads up -- everyone who has backed at Hiro Protagonist level or above should have received a message via Kickstarter with links to the PDF and EPUB versions of Cincinnati Stories, so double check your spam if you've not received anything.

Even if you cancel, you keep the free books.  https://www.audible.com/pd/Maxwell-Cain-Burrito-Avenger-Audiobook/B07QJYZPXK  Everyone should either have their product at this time or will receive their signed copy soon. If any of you have an issue, let me know.  One last time: Thank you so much for your immense support and encouragement. Burrito Avenger only exists because each of you gave generously to see it realized. Our adventure together is at an end, but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be back soon with a new story for all of you to enjoy!  Until we meet again,Adam',\n 'Hello again backers!  Just wanted to let everyone know that the paperback version was accepted and is up for sale on Amazon. That means I have also shipped every paperback out to each person who backed at the Paperback Punk level. I copied and pasted each of your addresses exactly as you filled out in your survey, and the package will ship straight from Amazon to your home.  Signed paperbacks have been ordered in bulk and will be delivered to me soon, at which point I will sign them and mail them out to backers at the Signature Scoundrel level and above.  Thank you once again everyone for your patience as we worked on getting these paperbacks out.   Until next time!  -Adam',\n 'Hello again everyone!  Burrito Avenger released yesterday, and the response has been huge! For the past 36 hours I have been inundated with pictures of readers eating burritos and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m loving every minute of it.  While the Kindle version is tearing up the sales charts, Amazon pushed back the paperback version twice with an error message that did not make sense. I got some assistance from a colleague and discovered the issue was an entirely separate problem from what the error message claimed. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve submitted the paperback again for the third time and it should work now. That should be live in a day or two, pending Amazon approval. The moment it clears IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be shipping paperbacks to everyone as promised.  Because of these setbacks, the paperbacks will all ship in April instead of March as promised. I deeply apologize to all of you loyal supporters for the delay and want to assure you I am working to get the product to each of you as fast as possible. Thank you for your ongoing patience.  The audiobook version is fully submitted and awaiting approval within Audible. Once that completes, all three versions of the book will be live on Amazon!  As of right now the book is rocketing upward through the ranks of MenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Adventure Fiction. If we get into the top 10, Amazon starts pushing the book hard in emails and ads, so get your friends and family into the book!  Reviews help tremendously when prospective readers are considering buying. If youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve read the book, please consider leaving a short review on the Amazon page (link below). Even just one sentence and a star score helps. Readers see those stars and unconsciously link them to popularity of the book, so every review helps!  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MWPZJ8D/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KRsOCb1MV2K4J  Thank you so much for your patience and support! The release is going great, and several interviews are lined up for the coming two weeks!  Until next time!  -Adam',\n 'Hello again!  The final release date for Maxwell Cain: Burrito Avenger is March 30th, which is this coming Saturday. Release day is almost here!  Those of you waiting for paperback copies will be pleased to know your books will be ordered this weekend. My intention is to submit the paperback for approval on Friday. Amazon has an approval process anywhere from a few hours to a day or two, but in my experience itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fairly fast.  The moment the paperback gets approved, I will sit down and order every unsigned paperback copy straight to backersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 addresses provided on your response surveys. Amazon will print your copy of the book at the printing hub nearest your house and then mail it straight to you.  I will also be placing a large bulk order of paperbacks for those of you who ordered signed copies. Because they will need to come to me first before I can ship and send them, your signed copies will likely ship out in April instead of March as originally stated. I apologize for this wait time. I had hoped Amazon would let me print copies ahead of release day, but thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not the case. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll keep this in mind for future campaigns.  The audiobook version is in editing and looks like it should release on the same day as both text versions. Amazon is a little weird with how they handle approval and release dates of audiobooks, but the synchronized release should take place as close together as possible. The audiobook producer/narrator is hard at work and the samples IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve heard have been excellent!  Thank you everyone for your support in making this book a reality, and for your patience as the process rolls along!',\n 'Just received two paperback proofs of Burrito Avenger. Looking over them for flaws or mistakes, and they are gorgeous! Just a few pictures included.  For those wondering, the book is 239 pages long.  Note: Proof copies have NOT FOR RESALE stamped across the front. Real copies without that bar are not available until after publication.',\n 'Hello everyone!  Wanted to drop a line and say that everyone should have a digital copy of Burrito Avenger in their email inbox. Instructions on how to read the book are Included. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and ask.  For those of you awaiting paperbacks, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m still working diligently to figure out how early I can send those out. It looks like I will have to fully publish the paperback for public purchase before I can get author copies, so the paperbacks will likely be ordered for print on March 30th when Burrito Avenger releases and then Amazon will ship the book to your house as soon as the book is printed. Signed copies will take a little longer due to double shipping.  I look forward to everyoneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feedback on the book!  Thanks so much for helping bring Burrito Avenger to life!',\n 'Just a heads up to all you backers: The Amazon pre-order page for the digital version of Burrito Avenger on Amazon has gone live. Amazon does not allow for a paperback pre-order for lowly schmucks like myself. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MWPZJ8D  Note the street date is March 30th, 5 weeks after you backers will receive your digital copies via email. Feel free to share the pre-order link with your friends who didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get in on the campaign. Maybe you can even gloat a little.  The final copy of the book is now 37% edited and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be tackling it again this weekend. Still on track to have the digital copy to all of you by February 23rd.',\n 'Fresh on the heels of the last project update...  Today IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been editing Burrito Avenger and speaking with the professional formatter. The book is in good shape and only needs about 30 hours of editing, which should be easy to knock out. Then several rounds of proofreading. The formatter has set up an appointment in early February and has committed to returning the finalized copy to me by February 23rd.  This means I should be able to ship out digital copies to every backer on February 23rd, 6 weeks from today!  Paperback copies will need to be submitted to Amazon first and approved before I can print and ship them. Signed copies will take a little longer. I am committed to having all of these out to backers by early March, right on schedule.  I am working with the audiobook narrator to get the audio version done by March 30th for a simultaneous release of digital, paperback, and audiobook versions released on Amazon. As I promised in the campaign, backers will have the digital copy at least 2 weeks before it goes on sale (actually about 5 weeks in this case).  Thanks again for your support in making this wacky project a reality!',\n 'Burrito Avenger is entering its final form!  I received the heavily annotated manuscript back from the professional editor you all helped me pay for. 3,644 comments were added to the document including punctuation corrections, word changes, criticism, and positive commentary on particularly juicy bits.  My first book, Making Peace, had about double the number of noted suggestions due to the rough learning process during writing. With this same editorÃ¢\\x80\\x99s help, that book went on to earn almost unanimous perfect review scores on Amazon.  Today IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sitting down and applying as much of the professional feedback as I feel suits my vision for Burrito Avenger. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve also got two additional short chapters to add at the suggestion of the editor to help even out the pacing. He said the action stays too intense for too long and the reader needs a light breather in two spots.  IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll take that as a compliment on a job well done.  After the final draft will come extensive proofreading, and then IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll ship this baby to the formatter to make it beautiful.  The goal right now is to have the digital copy to all backers by mid to late February, ahead of schedule. Paperback editions will follow shortly thereafter.  I am also working with the voice actress to release all three editions simultaneously on Amazon. If we can make this happen, we will.  Thanks for your support! Burrito Avenger is nearing completion!',\n 'Hello again everyone!  Wanted to touch base and let everyone know the funds have cleared and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve already spent $1,900. Sure felt bizarre to blow so much money within minutes, but the professionals were lined up and waiting!  The editor has been fully paid and is already working on the manuscript early. He estimates a 2-week turnaround before I get the annotated manuscript back to begin making my own changes for the final version, so that should be in my possession shortly after New Years. I woke up this morning to see him praising the quality of the work on social media, so take that as a good sign.  The cover artist has been fully paid and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got the high-resolution cover art. He also gave the main character blue eyes this time to match the story, so IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m including the new art here.  The audiobook voice actress has been fully paid and sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s awaiting the final version to immediately begin recording and editing the audiobook, to be released sometime later in the Spring. Her work is always top-notch and sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s incredibly detailed, so look forward to that announcement down the line.  After all this comes my own final editing during January and then the formatting. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve hired a professional to format the entire book for both paperback and ebook versions, and heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s also going to take the cover art and create a spine and back cover for the paperback. He takes a few days.  As things stand, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m hoping to have the ebook copy distributed to all of you well ahead of schedule by mid-February.  Thank you to all of you who made this possible. None of these services could have been paid for without your support.',\n 'The cover art for Burrito Avenger is finalized! Attached is the low-resolution image. I get the high-resolution piece when I pay the artist.  And speaking of paying, Kickstarter has finished sorting the funds and will be depositing them to me this week. Thank you to everyone who followed through on their pledge!  IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been in contact with the editor and heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s expecting the manuscript and payment in 6 days to begin finalizing the book. This guy is ruthless and will spare no feelings when he rips the story apart for ways to improve.  Big thanks to all of you who made this possible!',\n 'Burrito Avenger fully funded at 255%! Thank you to all of you who made this possible. I should receive the funds in 2-3 weeks, around December 22nd.  Where do we go from here?  The cover artist has already begun work and will have the completed cover on or around December 22nd. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve included the rough concept sketch in this update and will share improved sketch and coloring updates as I receive them.  The professional editor will take the manuscript December 22nd and has promised 2 week turnaround.  For now, enjoy the cover artistÃ¢\\x80\\x99s extremely rough sketch of the cover! (Ignore the typo in the white text, artists are not hired for proofreading skills.)',\n 'Just wanted to share an update. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been in contact with both the cover artist and professional editor and the news is excellent.  The editor is planning to have the manuscript finished in the first week or two of January, which puts us ahead of schedule. After that will come applying the changes and proofreading, then professional formatting.  The cover artist is beginning research for the art this week and will be drawing up some preliminary sketches. We are currently on track to have the finished cover well before New YearÃ¢\\x80\\x99s.  IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll share more as information becomes available.  Again, thank you for supporting this project!',\n 'The Burrito Avenger campaign stands now at $2,499 with a week remaining! The goal for an audiobook was $2,500, so we will call this a victory!  This success means the audiobook will be developed alongside the digital and paperback versions. We are looking at options to do a simultaneous Amazon release of all three versions.  This will not at all delay the release of Burrito Avenger to you, my backers. My commitment is to have the book out to each of you by the target date at the latest, and early if at all possible.  As an added update, I will be completing my own self-edits of the manuscript tomorrow. The rough draft has proven to be smooth and requires very few changes before sending it to the professional editor, which your pledges helped pay for. After I get the book back from him I will apply whichever of his recommended changes fit the vision of the story and then begin the thorough proofreading process to ensure you all receive the highest quality product I can provide.  Be advised that the campaign ends in one week and you will be charged then, so double check your funding and expect the withdrawal. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want anyone unpleasantly surprised at the close on November 30th.  Thank you so much to each of you for your immense support and aid as we bring this book to life.',\n 'The immensely talented voice actress Jennifer Ledford recorded a cool new commercial for the novel.

I wanted to give everyone an update on how things are going behind the scenes.  ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been 5 days and we are almost doubly funded. The Kickstarter is due to end December 1st, and Kickstarter estimates 2 weeks until the funds are available and 1 more week to withdraw them. That puts payment right about December 22nd.  IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve scheduled the cover artist to have the finished cover art done December 22nd and ready to share. This wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have the text markup, just the art itself. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll post it here as soon as I get it. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m hoping to also post some of the initial sketches along the way if the artist is comfortable with that.  The professional editor needs half payment up front before he begins, so heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s scheduled to receive the manuscript December 22nd. HeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s usually got a 3-week turnaround so IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m hoping to get the book back early to mid January. At that point IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll apply corrections and strenuous additional proofreading before shipping it to the professional formatter.  The goal is to have a book with gorgeous cover art, zero typos, and formatted beautifully in all editions.

You made this campaign a success, and you allowed me to continue the dream of being a novelist. I've said on many occasions that people have different motivations to write.

Early in the campaign I'd written that your pledge came in designated by a code number, not a name. I've learned that is part of Kickstarter's privacy policy. My friend and fellow writer Karen Huntsberger let me know that after successful completion, Kickstarter will replace those codes with your name. At that point, if I don't already have your mailing address, I'll contact you individually to get it.

When I went downstairs I found my wife running a plate under hot water so I wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have to eat from a cold dish.  Watching her, I was struck with the thought, good grief, am I spoiled.  There many people Ã¢\\x80\\x93 millions? Ã¢\\x80\\x93 who would love to have something, anything, to eat.  TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d love to have clean water.  And here we are warming a plate with water you could drink.  DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get me wrong, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbadÃ¢\\x80\\x9d because weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re able to do this sort of thing.  I am just grateful.  We are so blessed.    .  HereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a lovely blurb I got from Emily Grosvenor, editor of Oregon Home Magazine:     Stephen Long captures the cadences of the rural West with a poet's precision: the landscapes and pit stops of South Dakota, the quiet frustrations of characters accepting their lot while pushing up against the expectations of others, the everyday banter of workaday folk who are anything but.  All Hat  is, in the end, a love story, one with the heart of a Western, and just as much fun.  Ã‚\\xa0  ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fun to hear different interpretations of any work, whether itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a painting, sculpture, live performance, or literature.  As IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said before, I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think I was writing a western, it just happens to take place in the west.  But there you are.  Some readers seem to think differently.Ã‚\\xa0  WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got four days left in the campaign; it ends this Saturday and thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s $1789 still to raise.  I know a  couple folks who have said theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll pledge, but if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d like to share the Kickstarter link friends that would be great.  Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving.Ã‚\\xa0  Steve\",\n \"Hey Backers,  This isn't so much an update as it is an expression of gratitude, and also a bit of a mea culpa.Ã‚\\xa0 I've written to a few of you individually to thank you for your generous support, but mostly I've communicated to the group through these blanket updates. Believe me, it isn't my preferred method. For some reason only a few pledges have shown up with a name attached, while the vast majority are just a string of numbers for identification. Unless they are the codes to your Swiss bank accounts, I have no idea how they were assigned, but the result is they mask who you are.Ã‚\\xa0 I'm hoping at the end of the campaign all will be revealed, but if it isn't done automatically I will reply to each number, find out who you are, get the address, and get your reward in the mail.Ã‚\\xa0Ã‚\\xa0  Okay, so maybe a  smallÃ‚\\xa0 update, I worked on the cover art today and think it's a pretty good design. It should be; I stole it ... I mean I  researched Ã‚\\xa0it by looking at the jackets of several other books and taking the most appropriate elements. My actions bear out the adage: If you borrow from one it's plagiarism, if you borrow from several it's research.  Ã‚\\xa0And a final thought, we're getting close to the end, just 10 days to go.Ã‚\\xa0 We're doing well, but with an all-or-nothing format this might be close. So please share the Kickstarter link with anyone you feel might be interested. Let's push this over the top!  Thanks!\",\n \"Hello Backers!Ã‚\\xa0Ã‚\\xa0  Well, darn. I worried the printer's schedule would prevent a before-Christmas shipment, and that now seems to be the case. I had an email conversation with them today and I was told their lead-time is running about 30 working days. As you know, one of the rewards is inclusion in the acknowledgements, and pledging (backing the project) doesn't end until November 24. I have to wait until after that date to send the digital file to the printer in case a late backer qualifies for inclusion. All-in-all it doesn't leave enough time for them to print the books, ship them to me, and me ship to you. So we're probably looking at mid-January to get them in the mail. Delayed gratification.  But in the GOOD NEWS column, I'm getting some fabulous blurbs for the jacket. I can't wait to share them with you.  And one more item; I may re-take the photo of the brand being burned into the wood. My wife Cathy, who is much more artistic than I, thinks the current photo is at the wrong angle. So this is a good time to thank my daughter Jeni, whose barn we're branding (and NOT burning down), and my brother Rob for fabricating the brand. Thanks guys.  And thank you all for supporting my dream.  Steve\",\n 'The project has now been processed by Kickstarter which means the books can be sent.

Enjoy the rest of your weekend.  Lots of love,  Fanny\",\n \"After day one, the project is already 53% funded, which is more than I could have imagined or hoped for.  Thank you so much!

I hope that this party would include an artist talk-back, book signing, and gallery exhibition of the Symbol Series. But, I would also like to invite several other local performance artists, and give them the space to perform there own work. What a great joy and fun gathering this could be!

In order to maintain the aura of mystique surrounding my doings (which is, as you know, deeply important to me), I wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be including the audiobooks at this time. Okay, so the real reason is we hit some production snags which slowed down the process a bit. Never fear! Like a good wine, marinating steak, or Sean Connery, it will only benefit from the passing of time. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll definitely keep you in the loop as the time grows near to release that to you.

Ã‚\\xa0   Unfortunately, my regular printer for Wildside Press books went out of business, and I have been having a devil of a time getting all the ducks lined up to publish the Frozen Hell paperback and hardcover.

Ã‚\\xa0It took a while, but I have now found a box manufacturer who can do small runs of magnetically-sealed, archival-quality boxes for the lettered editions, and I will be going with them.

We hope you have the best, happiest, and safest New Year, and we will be updating you shortly with new amazing things for this thing.\",\n \"If you haven't already completed your survey, please take a moment to do so. We still have 1900 surveys outstanding. We want to wrap up the project in a timely manner.  The survey is in an email from BackerKit.Ã‚\\xa0  Why do we want you to complete it? We need you to verify your email address and/or mailing address, and confirm which items you want. This way there will be no mistakes, and no mis-shipped items.  If you can't find your survey, please check your spam filter. Or search your email for BackerKit. Or check to see if KickStarter has your email address wrong (you can correct it!)  If you still can't find the email with the survey, or forgot to pledge for an item you wanted, BackerKit has a support page for Frozen Hell here:  https://frozenhell.backerkit.com/  HAPPY HOLIDAYS!  John\",\n \"I have submitted the BackerKit survey to the full list. There was a small error in shipping prices for add-ons, but I believe I have fixed it. You should be able to complete all the info you need to receive your items.  Bob Eggleton has advised me that he can't deliver the artwork until Jan. 16, because we added so much (remember, we added a color frontispiece for the hardcovers and interior illustrations after he had agreed to do the cover).Ã‚\\xa0 This will push back the publication date a few weeks. I'm sure it will be worth the wait!  The BackerKit store is located here, if you didn't order yet and still want to:  https://frozenhell.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders  And of course you can also pre-order through our web site, wildsidepress.com  It will be up until at last Jan. 16th, when we hope to finalize quantities for the printer.

Campbell, Jr., Evelyn, and myself, we are amazed and delighted by the outpouring of support!  Since the campaign ended, I have received several dozen messages saying \"Sorry, I missed it -- can I still pledge?\" or \"Can I add something?\"  The answer is -- no and yes!Ã‚\\xa0 No, Kickstarter has ended the campaign, so it can\\'t be changed directly. However, you will be allowed to add things to your order when you receive the BackerKit survey in a few weeks. BackerKit will allow you to choose exactly what you want (and order other items, if you wish). It will also gather the shipping info we need to get your items to you.  Altenatively, Kickstarter allows us to sell items directly after the campaign ends. I am working to set them up now at our web site, wildsidepress.com (use the navigation bar on the left to select U.S. or International for your shipping option).Ã‚\\xa0 Everything should be up by tomorrow.

I honestly believe there\\'s no more supportive and dedicated band of Kickstarter backers than mine, and I know exactly how lucky I am to have you with me.  Backing a Kickstarter campaign is a leap of faith. Not everyone has the generosity of spirit to take it. Not everyone looks at their table and says, \"Yeah, I\\'ve got a little room at the end there. Go ahead and sit down. Make yourself at home.\"  Thanks for making room for me at your table. As always, I\\'ll do my best to make your leap worth the leaping.Ã‚\\xa0  Best regards,  Mike',\n \"Barring any unforeseen changes of heart (it happens, if rarely), we've pushed past the finish line!  I'm exhausted. Here on Long Island, we're in the midst of what's turned into a pretty hairy ice storm. I just helped to push a few cars up a hill--not even that big a hill under normal circumstances, but in these conditions impossible to negotiate without a helping hand.  I didn't know the other people--either the ones I was helping or the other helpers. But together, we got it done.Ã‚\\xa0  Which brings me to this campaign. At this point, I feel like you're all neighbors. And it felt good to push--all of us--in the same direction. I hope you guys felt the same way.  Thanks from the bottom of my heart. I've said it before and I'll say it again--you guys rock!  Best,  Mike\",\n 'My friends,  Thanks to a bit of a surge in the last hour or so, there\\'s a light at the end of this month-long tunnel.Ã‚\\xa0  I\\'ve been a baseball fan too long to think we can\\'t lose it in the bottom of the ninth, but at least we\\'ve got a shot. That\\'s all you can really ask for, and not only when it comes to Kickstarter campaigns.  You guys have been amazing, even better than I\\'d hoped. You inspire me. So if we actually fund this puppy and you get a chance to read these stories, know that you\\'re in them, regardless of whether you see your name or not. You not only made them possible, you gave me the oomph I needed to do my best.  Because in the end, this is a partnership. Any writer who doesn\\'t see that, and who isn\\'t humbled by the fact, still has a lot to learn.  By the way...I\\'m adding a story called \"Daughter of Dread\" to the book. It\\'s an homage to Stan Lee and what might be his greatest creation, The Fantastic Four. Originally it was a stretch goal at $3,750 but I\\'m throwing it in no matter what. You know, for Stan\\'s sake.  Best regards,  Mike',\n \"My friends,  In some alternate universe, we're already funded and I can sit back and enjoy the stretch run. Unfortunately, in THIS universe we're still $600 short with 35 hours to go, and I'm feverishly scouring obscure corners of the internet for backers.Ã‚\\xa0  So if you know anyone who might be interested in the kind of science fiction and fantasy I write, please don't hesitate to spread the word. The universe you save may be your own!  Best,  Mike\",\n 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MCQPoeGorI',\n '...was one of Stan Lee\\'s favorite words. It was the one he offered to \"true believers\" in his admittedly melodramatic but also eminently powerful vision of a world in which ordinary men and women struggled daily with the burden of godlike abilities.  At a time in which our country was mired in doubt and despair, Stan picked out the best in human nature and put it on display for us, in his always casual way giving us a moral compass by which many of us still live.  \"Excelsior\"invites us not only to dream of better times, but to dream BIG. To dream BEYOND anything we\\'ve previously imagined. It\\'s a daunting challenge...but I\\'m confident we \"true believers\" are up to it.  Best,  Mike',\n \"My peeps,  Having been through several of these Kickstarter campaigns before, I can say two things with a certainty:  1) My campaigns have always been rescued at the end by the cavalry...sometimes in the last few minutes. It's nerve wracking and I'm sure it's taken a few months off my life, but it's a fact.  2) #1 above belies all the work that goes into getting the word out beforehand--not just on my part, but also on the parts of those incredible, dedicated backers who believe in the value of independent publishing, backers to whom I'm profoundly indebted and will continue to be so.  So if you've got a moment, please help me alert others about this campaign. Even one blast on Facebook or Twitter would be a huge help--and could easily be the difference between  Headless  succeeding or foundering short of its goal.  Thanks for everything,  MikeÃ‚\\xa0\",\n \"My peeps,  The  Pangaea  series of anthologies, which posits an Earth where mankind has grown up exclusively on a super-continent, features the work of some of science fiction's finest writers--names you'll recognize from Hugo and Nebula award competitions as well as other prestigious venues. I was pleased and honored to have the chance to both edit and contribute to these impressive collections.  I just added a new $65 reward that delivers not only  Headless and Other Improbable Excitations of The Muse  (in both trade paperback and DRM-free e-editions) but also trade paperback editions of the first two books in the  Pangaea  series, each one signed by at least three featured authors--three books in all!

That is, we can place your noble visage, rendered by the very talented Caio Cacau, on one of the three starship crewpeople left.Ã‚\\xa0  A number of backers have said they're considering stepping forward and claiming one of the three still-available spots. My advice: Don't wait too long. When they're gone, they're--unfortunately--gone, and no amount of star-hopping is going to get them back.  So picture yourself manning the bridge of a starship and consider the possibilities.

ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fitting that the  Crimson Keep  story keeps growing in odd and unexpected ways, because thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s exactly what the  Crimson Keep  itself does: it keeps growing in odd and unexpected ways, which is why you never know whom youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll bump into. The mighty wizard known only as The Master, who rules the place? One of his more ambitious students? A demon trying to claw his way back to prominence? Assorted noblemen, warriors, minstrels, and lost souls...maybe even a graybeard leading some little fellows with furry feet?   Tales of the Crimson Keep: Newly Renovated Edition  is on sale now atÃ‚\\xa0 Crazy8Press.com , both as a paperback and as a DRM-free e-book.

Yep, the last big thing to do is over 100 goody packs of chopsticks, art cards, and bracelets, but the last package of bracelets is  still not here.

I\\'m so excited!Ã‚\\xa0  I was poking through the arcane online records system of our print-on-demand printer (Ingram/Lightning Source) when I realized that the number of orders showing up in our \"pending\" queue had gone down. I looked to make sure it wasn\\'t because some orders got cancelled for some arcane reason and discovered.... lo, and behold! It\\'s because  some of the pending orders actually got shipped!   Most of the other orders are at least showing the status of \"printing\" and they have printing locations assigned. The one above shows a printing plant in Ohio. Others are coming from places including LaVergne, Tennessee, and Fresno, California. It looks to me like the orders that were assigned to the Ohio plant have shipped, while the others are still in the manufacturing step.Ã‚\\xa0  It also looks to me like  *most* of the orders being fulfilled from Ohio are in the midwest,  and mid-south. Lightning Source isn\\'t always sensible about this, though. I can see some orders that are to go to Massachusetts being printed in Fresno...?Ã‚\\xa0   But the big news is that some of the books are already on the way,  and the rest will follow as the printing backlogs gradually clear. Hooray!!   Autographed  copies will probably not make it out until the first or second week of January, depending on when the books get to me. (And lets hope the dang red bracelets have turned up by then!)  Meanwhile, I see in social media posts today that the TEA packages have been arriving!

I thought today you'd enjoy a peek at what the long scarf will look like. Personally I can't wait to see what it FEELS like. :-)Ã‚\\xa0       I took Stephanie Inagaki's cover art illustration, and also the high resolution scan of the washi paper background she sent me. And then I painstakingly removed areas of the background and some of the flowers and leaves using Photoshop. I used this new washi background as a detail on the back cover of the paperback and also for the scarf design.

We're in the final four days of our campaign, still edging closer to our Ã‚Â£1,100 push-goal and all the bounties it contains. We're a long way off our pipe-dream of a professional pay-say for all our authors, but I guess we have to accept that was no more than an impossible dream...  ...it's time to move on...  ...to stop being irrational...   NEVER!   We may be crazy, but maybe somewhere out there a mad investor is just waiting for the right pack of loonies to shower limitless resources upon! Maybe there are lots of them!Ã‚\\xa0Ã‚\\xa0  Therefore, we have added three more tiers specifically for backers with more money than sense - come throw your wealth away! Think of all the good it could do (for us), how much lighter and more comfortable your wallet will feel in your pocket when you've unburdened yourself.Ã‚\\xa0  Remember,  you can't take it all with you when you've gone - but  we  can certainly take it from you  now !\",\n \"Thanks again - we've achieved our mini-goal of accumulating fifty backers!Ã‚\\xa0  In return, alongside the ebook rewards we'll be issuing everyone with a genuine* Pacific Citizen's Birth Certificate! This essential proof of identity** is all you'll need to make it in the wide world out there.  We're still hoping to reach our Ã‚Â£1,100 push goal, and to this end we've announced a new premium reward tier:  Round-Robin, the Story Wonder Ã‚\\xa0offers the chance to appear in the collection as a super hero (or villain) in an original story, collectively written by our contributors!

In addition, Lance has offered a bonus story, proof positive that not only the bad guys are prone to monologuing - if we hit our 2cpw target,  W2PC  will have  fifteen  stories and illustrations instead!

We're delighted to find that, after just four days of fund-raising, the  Welcome to Pacific City  Kickstarter passed its primary goal of Ã‚Â£500, meaning we'll be able to increase the fees we've paid our contributors to a semi-professional rate of  one whole U.S. cent per word! Ã‚\\xa0  We want to pay them more than that, though, so there's every reason to give us more support.  It will be a big ask for us to reach 2cpw, or even the long-dreamed-of 6cpw that represents the status of a professional fiction market, but we can hold out hope until the very last day. However, we have a few more rewards to dangle before you...  PUSH GOALS  If we can increase our budget to Ã‚Â£750, we're going to break new ground for the  SFFWorld.com  anthology project: we'll make  Welcome to Pacific City  our first title available not just as an ebook but in  print  as well!  We've planted our sign deep in the sand, all thanks to you - but with your assistance maybe we can raise it a little higher...       We're also in negotiations with graphic novelist  Lance Tooks  to provide original artwork for  every story  in the collection - and maybe more. Lance cut his baby teeth at Marvel Comics (many decades ago!), so he knows a thing or two about superheroes and villains.  If you want to see what he's got for us, spread the word about the campaign and help push us through that 2cpw barrier. Every little helps!

Many thanks to everyone who has supported us in the campaign\\'s opening week - we\\'ve done  extremely Ã‚\\xa0well, hitting 88% of our primary goal in just four days!Ã‚\\xa0  We\\'re delighted to see people eager to check out Pacific City, and we\\'ve gained a cluster of acolytes for the Librarian\\'s cult wanting access to our previous anthologies as well. The tuckerization rewards are also going fast - so far we\\'ve recruited two cops, a newspaper journalist, Pacific City\\'s DA, the city\\'s top crook and the city\\'s most popular anchorperson, AND the actual Mayor!Ã‚\\xa0  To keep your attention, we\\'ve begun sharing  a series of short interviews  with the contributing writers in which we quiz them about their heroic and villainous tendencies (among other things).Ã‚\\xa0Also, two of them have shared teasers from their stories: you can sample cover star Tansy Rayner Roberts\\'s actual storyÃ‚\\xa0 here , and SFFWorld anthology stalwart Daniel Ausema gives a short summary  here .       As for our campaign, the earlybird tier is now closed, but to celebrate this strong beginning we\\'re now unveiling two additional tuckerizations which take place in the stories of our two guest authors, Matthew Hughes and Tansy Rayner Roberts:   THE CARPET-BACKER is a chance to appear in Matthew\\'s tale \"The Gift of Gabby\" as a nefarious player in the long-forgotten origins of the entire city; and  THE HACKER BACKER can become Head-Goon in Tansy\\'s yarn \"Purrfect Criminal\", an action comedy with claws (and other feline elements)   Both Matthew and Tansy are great writers and the stories they\\'ve contributed are a lot of fun, revealing the gritty past and the glossy present of our shared world. Villains have all the fun, don\\'t they?  Any extra exposure would go a long way to pushing us across the line, and we have plans for extra rewards if we can hit out mythical push-goals and raise even more funds for our contributors. So we hope you\\'ll spread the world (so to speak), and if one of those new tuckerizations catches your eye, don\\'t fight temptation!

THE GOAL HAS BEEN REACHED!  You get a book and you get a book and you get a book, because now it can be made a real thing. That's what this preorder was set up for - it gives me the funds to order the first batch of books, so they can make it to your front doorstep and palms.Ã‚\\xa0  This book broke my heart in 100 places. It let me live memories twice and three times - and gave me my mother when she was little and my father's cooking and my sister when I was her hero. It gave me thirty years right back into my lap.  I hope it gives you the same in different ways. Because that is why we write after all, to live twice and three times.  There is a STILL week left of this (specially priced) preorder, so share if you'd like. Now, go call your mother/hug your family/drink some water.  Love always,   Brittany\",\n \"Bee Mindful event at ModernWell    Last week, I posted up at ModernWell for the Bee Mindful event, hosted by  Sarah Edwards. Ã‚\\xa0I went to promote BORDERLINE and write poems for those attending.Ã‚\\xa0It was on a Wednesday. We were all tired. But the minute I stepped into the spacious white room of ModernWell with a typewriter swinging at my hips, I felt at home.  Don't we all live for those serendipitous moments that pop up in our hearts and minds when we least expect them? All I had was a typewriter loaded with ink, 100 sheets of stark white paper, some champagne, and a room  full  of incredible humans. As women began to trickle in, the hollow clunking of my typing drew them to where I was posted in the middle of the room. Perhaps there's something nostalgic about the sound of the keys, or the curves of the typewriter's body.  All they had to do was tell me what  allowed them find inner peace and their favorite song was lately . Then, I punched out a little poem.  BORDERLINE  is about finding mindfullness after all - mindfullness of sensory triggers and soul. And writing the poems for these people I had never met felt effortless. Simply based on how we all took a moment to realize we are the most brave when we take a deep breath.  Before we all knew it, we were hugging and tearing up. The evening was exactly what we needed, using the spirits of one another to figure out the world. Some things we learned: typos are inevitable and sometimes the most crucial element of life and the typewriter, we can't possibly know what everyone is going through, words of affirmation are entirely powerful, and being brave is a lot about love.  One of my favorite poems was for a woman named Kimberly Clairmont. She told me she baths soothed her during stressful days and (I don't remember the song, but I know it had something to do with love).  I kept the typos.  It went:  the water covers everything  all but my eyes, avove the surface.  the water covers everything  all but my worries, above the surface.  the water covers everything  all but my heart  i leave it above the surface  - a poem for kimberly clairmont      Photo by Lauren Engfer         Photo by Lauren Engfer      All photos by  Lauren Engfer.\",\n \"It's whichever way you choose!

There is some sparking as the trolley slips wheel over track by force of momentum. The whole atmosphere has a peculiar gravity, despite certain incongruities. The entry through rubberized flaps resembling those of a fun house into a mucosal tube that seemed to be breathing. A succession of dangling insects and others are stuck to IckeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fly trap tongue, in the grips of a thing, an it, straining.

No, probably not into gold--this being the religious platform, obviously. But something. Because I believe in it.  In as much as I once so believed in my aversive power, that the universe has determined to correct it, and is now overcorrecting in my opinion.

Luckily, the reading helped immensely. I seriously can't wait till I finish the text and share the story with you.  Meanwhile, I have a favour to ask. I've sent out surveys to every backer and from some of you I'll need the names of the characters. It would be great if you could send me the names as soon as possible. I've got a few names and they have surely set my imagination on fire. I'm honestly forever indebted.  So, send me the names! I'll make sure I create great characters out of them. :)\",\n \"I don't know what else to say except THANK YOU. I promise you you're going to enjoy the story. Thanks for riding with me.\",\n \"I managed to finish quite a bit today at home. I tried watching a DVD and reading a few books but eventually I got back on my MacBook. I didn't go to the pier today but know that the dogs that lived at the pier are now all safe indoors.  For those of you who know me personally, you'd probably know that our Siu Hak used to live in the pier. He lived there for approximately five months before officially becoming our pet. Before that he had been abandoned twice, which also meant that when he lived on the pier, he had been used to living a life indoors. I couldn't imagine how he endured those months. It was winter and spring when he lived there and the cold and dampness could really get to your bones sometimes. Dogs are a special creature. Whenever I have to go through some tough times, I'd look at Siu Hak and seek strength from him. I seek strength from God, too. But it's a totally different thing. One of the reasons we decided to keep Siu Hak was that he wasn't all that big for our 300+ sq ft flat. We thought we could manage as a family of four. But each day we had him each day we were thinking, 'Why did he seem to be getting bigger?' Apparently, he gained a total of 10 lbs after staying with us and now he's considered fit, not fat. God knows how he managed those 5 months at the pier by himself.  This isn't the first time I've written about Siu Hak. Because of how special he is I've reserved a spot for him in the book.  I'm quite happy with my progress. Though there have been times when I have doubts and feel insecure, I have yet to lose faith. It is so lovely to have you guys along the ride as I write.\",\n \"Thank you very much for your generous support. We have reached our funding goal of HK$5000. At this moment of speaking, I just finished the fourth chapter. There had been moments when I cringed and wondered if I could finish this feast. Luckily I'd been doing some reading at the same time, and some of which is about writing. Apparently, it really is a test of endurance. Then, I wondered, is my work going to do what I wanted it to do? Isn't it hateful when insecurity steps in. Right now, I'll focus on producing good chapters and telling a good story. Bye for now.\",\n \"Just as I'm about to walk one of my dogs at the pier today, I'm happy to say that I've just finished writing another chapter that I'm proud of. There are still 20 days to go but we're still a bit short of the amount pledged. Would anyone like to have a lunch buffet with me (and get a copy of the book when it's done)? :)\",\n \"Hiya.  You may have noticed that under the campaign story I have included an excerpt from the book. I hope you like what you read.  My editor and I just had an effective meeting discussing the story, our time frame of work, etc. We are pretty confident that we'll produce a book that will be both enjoyable to read and meaningful. We will be meeting on the 1st or 2nd Sunday every month, and my editor has access to my manuscripts 24/7 so there really is no way for me to be lazy. My editor has really been nothing but wonderful and awesome. I honestly don't know how this project could be completed without her.  Guess that's all for now. I'll go back to writing.\",\n \"Hey guys, thanks for the pledges. You have no idea how much they mean to me. &lt;3  Take some time to think about what names you want your characters to be so that they can fire my imagination to the max. :)  I'll ask you about them as well as your mailing address when the backing period is over.\",\n \"Thank you to all our backers!

That usually takes about two weeks, so sometime right after the first of the month we will send out our surveys.Ã‚\\xa0  For those of you with the lifetime subscriptions to the workshops, Dean will be contacting you directly in the next few days about those subscriptions. But it will be after the first of the month for everything else.  Once again, thank you everyone from all of us involved with the fantastic project called  Fiction River.

The two extra books are first a very special edition of  Fiction River  called  Spies . Edited by Kristine Kathryn Rusch. Remember, the special editions are not included in regular subscriptions, but now everyone here will get a copy of it.Ã‚\\xa0  Also, because we have reached this stretch goal, everyone will also get a copy of Kris Nelscott's new thrilling novel  Protectors.  It is a stunning thriller set in 1968 around the start of the woman's self defense movement.

That status is: good. Five chapters have been written, which represent about a third to a quarter of the total book depending on how messy the climax gets. I could have phrased that better. Momentum is steady, and we remain on course to meet our predicted launch date of December, 2019.  In the coming days, you should receive an email from BackerKit. That's where shipping is being handled and you can pick up add-ons a la carte. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have a more accurate estimation of shipping costs by thenÃ¢\\x80\\x94having just completed fulfillment of our previous campaign, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen some prices go up (mainly international shipping), so weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re working on ways to keep those down.

Lewis in a dark room (the audioubliette) for hours a dat with only water, bread, and fidget spinners to sustain himself. And you helped put him there. Thank you!  We're Not Going to Hit These Other Stretch Goals, but Since I Had Them in Draft Form Already, We're Going to Post Them Anyway.   Just for sake of completion. 33 minutes left.  WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re totally in uncharted territory now. If we somehow (we won't) manage to hit  $18,000  in the next 32, we will also produce an audio book of  Hopjockey,  my previous novel, to be read by male siren Brian S. Lewis.  All backers at the $25 and up will receive the  Hopjockey  audio book  in addition to their regular rewards.  And, should the stars somehow align (unlikely) and fate sing us unprecedented fortune (not happening), if we reach  $20,000  in the next 31 minutes, we will  also  also produce an audio book of my first novel,  PWNED,  also to be recorded by that debonair charm elemental, Brian S.

Hopefully we'll have that wrapped up soon and be able to get the books out. Thank you all for bearing with us!\",\n \"Morgon passed the  final  draft of   Heroes Fall   over to me last night. I'll be getting it off to the formatter this weekend, and we should have the ebook and print interior layouts done by early next week.  Meanwhile, the cover artist is hard at work putting together the new regular edition cover. As soon as that's done, we'll be ready to get   Heroes Fall   out the door!  PS: Some of you may also be interested in our newest project from three time Dragon Award nominated horror author Declan Finn:    Saint Tommy, NYPD   .   My name is Detective Thomas Nolan, and I am a saint.    This is neither boasting nor an exaggeration.      I only had an inkling on the morning I chased Anthony Young, purse snatcherÃ¢\\x80Â¦again.  Kid was four years older than my son. Young Anthony (see what I did there?), a 20th time offender, had upgraded to double duty, on this day both snatching the purse as well as the iPhone of Malinda Jones. Malinda was one of many careless New Yorkers who are so deep into their phones that they barely registered oncoming traffic, to heck with noticing a thief running up on them.   Read more about Tommy Nolan on our  Kickstarter page  - and note that we're only $82 away from unlocking a third book in the series!\",\n 'Serenity City: Heroes Fall  , the first Heroes Unleashed novel, has finished story editing and is in the final copy editing phase. We expect to have that done within the next few days, and then the manuscript will go off to our layout expert. I\\'ve also been in touch with our cover artist to get him started on the \"non-special-edition\" cover. As soon as we have the finalized covers and laid out book, we\\'ll begin getting ebooks out to everyone. It\\'ll take another week or two after that to review physical proofs, get prints ordered, and get books signed, before we get hardcovers and paperbacks out to backers - but it\\'s all moving along!',\n \"Thank you so much to all of our backers who helped us blow past our goal! Here's a quick overview of what to expect from here:  We're currently hard at work putting all of the finishing touches on the first Heroes Unleashed novel,   Serenity City: Heroes Fall   by Morgon Newquist. We expect to have the ebook version out to backers by the end of this month. Print versions  should Ã‚\\xa0be off to the printer at around the same time, but there are several variables at play that could push that into early October. Primarily, it's down to how quickly we get the covers finalized and how quickly we can get proofs turned around.  After that, it'll be about six weeks between book releases. As noted in the campaign overview, backers will get all books first (with the caveat that we will allow reasonable time for international shipping, but won't wait forever). Only then will we put them up for sale.  If you ordered only one book, whether ebook, paperback, or hardcover, you will be receiving a message from us shortly to find out which of the five books you want. If you ordered physical books, we'll be contacting you for shipping addresses as well.  On behalf of the entire Heroes Unleashed team, I'd like to thank you again for your support. All of you mean the world to us!\",\n \"Thank you so much to everyone who has supported us this far! We're down to the final homeward stretch, so don't forget to spread the word and tell all your friends!\",\n 'ONLY FOR BACKERS',\n \"We're not even halfway finished with the Heroes Unleashed Kickstarter campaign, but we already had someone reach out to us expressing interest in helping us produce Heroes Unleashed graphic novels. Wow - that's kind of amazing!Ã‚\\xa0  I'm not sure if this one will come through or not, friend. But it's pretty cool to know people are interested. And I figured that you're probably curious about what our plans are for that space. Ã‚\\xa0  The short version: we really want to do them, but putting together comics and graphic novels is pretty expensive. Our vague plan has been that at some point in the future we'd run another crowdfunding campaign for the graphic novel project. That very well still may be the way we go. On the other hand, if industry pros are really that interested in doing it, maybe we'll just partner with somebody. Who knows? Ã‚\\xa0  But rest assured that we most definitely do want to move forward with that in the future. It's all just a matter of getting the right deal in place at the right time. Want to help make it happen? Make sure to let your friends know about our campaign! The more successful we are, the easier it is to do the extras!\",\n \"I mentioned that we have some awesome authors joining us in Phase II. And this one is a bit crazy... crazy AWESOME, that is!  A little while back we opened submissions on the Silver Empire site for science fiction novels. We got a number of manuscripts, but one really jumped out at us. Because if you follow our work - which is mostly urban fantasy, horror, and paranormal romance - then you'll understand why this one was so completely right up our alley.  We got a submission from a young man named Nos Jondi. Mr. Jondi is from Malawi, Africa. And the novel he sent us is...  werewolf and vampire space marines ! No, I'm not kidding - and yes, that's every bit as crazy awesome as it sounds!  What does this have to do with Heroes Unleashed? Well, we're working on polishing up Mr. Jondi's space vampire novel. Meanwhile, he's also hard at work on a new series for Heroes Unleashed!  We loved the way that Kai Wai Cheah brought a distinctly Asian flavor to Heroes Unleashed, and we're really looking forward to Mr. Jondi's distinctly African take on the genre.  Again, we can't promise this novel will be in Phase II - it might make a later phase. But it's definitely coming, and we can't wait!\",\n \"We're sitting high at 191% of our goal, and we still have more than 2/3 of the campaign to go! We can't thank you all enough for your amazing support.  Today we'd like to talk a little bit about where Heroes Unleashed goes from here. Because in addition to the five Phase I authors, and the sequels they're ready to move on to, we already have  four more authors  hard at work on  more Ã‚\\xa0Heroes Unleashed novels!  The exact lineup of Phase II hasn't been finalized yet. We know for sure that there will be a handful of new authors in it. It will probably also have a handful of sequels to the Phase I novels.Ã‚\\xa0  One thing we know for sure is that we'll have a book from new Heroes Unleashed author Paula Richey. Tentatively titled  Penance Copper: Redemption , Richey's book brings alien superheroes into the mix and takes an entirely new spin on the Heroes Unleashed world.  We've got a few author authors hard at work, and we'll have more announcements in the days to come! Thanks again for your support!\",\n \"4 days in and we're at 165% of our goal and nearly to 50 backers. That's pretty nice!   How would y'all like to get some extra artwork as a thank you?
